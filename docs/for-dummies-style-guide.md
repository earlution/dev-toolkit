# For Dummies Series Style Guide

**Formal Style Guide for "Vibe Coding For Dummies"**

This document establishes the writing standards, voice, tone, structure, and conventions for the For Dummies series. Use this guide when drafting chapters, sections, and all book content.

---

## 1. Book-Level Conventions

### 1.1 Title

- Use a clear working title in the form: **`X For Dummies`**
- Final title is subject to publisher revision, but the working title should clearly communicate the topic

### 1.2 Audience

- **Primary reader**: A smart beginner who knows little or nothing about X but is motivated to learn
- Assume basic general computer/reading literacy; do **not** assume prior domain knowledge
- The reader is intelligent but new to the topic—explain clearly without talking down

### 1.3 Purpose & Positioning

- **Promise**: Make X feel possible and practical for the reader
- The book is:
  - **Practical, not academic**: Focus on doing, not theory
  - **Reassuring, not overwhelming**: Help readers feel "I can do this"
  - **Selective, not exhaustive**: Cover what a motivated beginner genuinely needs

### 1.4 High-Level Structure

- Organize Parts and chapters so a browsing reader can map them to real problems or goals
- Favour functional, reader-oriented labels ("Getting Started", "Doing Y Task", "Solving Common Problems", "Taking It Further") over clever or abstract titles

---

## 2. Structure: Parts, Chapters, Sections

### 2.1 Parts

- **Typical count**: Aim for **4–6 Parts**

- **Usual pattern**:
  - **Part I: Getting Started with X**
    - Big-picture orientation, core concepts, and initial setup
  - **Part II: Doing the Core Stuff**
    - Day-to-day tasks and workflows the reader cares about most
  - **Part III: Digging Deeper / Advanced Use**
    - More powerful, specialized, or complex scenarios
  - **Part IV: The Part of Tens**
    - Lists of 10: tips, mistakes, tools, resources, shortcuts, etc.

- **Naming Parts**: Use clear, outcome-oriented titles that reflect what the reader can do after reading that Part

### 2.2 Chapters

- **Scope**: Each chapter tackles **one main problem or theme**
- **Dippability**: Chapters should be "dippable"—a reader can arrive mid-book and still follow without reading all previous chapters

- **Internal pattern (recommended)**:
  - **Short introduction (1–3 paragraphs)**:
    - State what the chapter covers
    - Explain why the reader should care
  - **3–6 sections**:
    - Each with descriptive, outcome-based headings
    - Include at least one step-by-step procedure (numbered list)
  - **Callouts**: Sprinkle in TIP, REMEMBER, WARNING, and TECHNICAL STUFF blocks as appropriate (see Section 4)
  - **Optional short wrap-up**: 1–2 paragraphs that summarize key takeaways and point to what's next

### 2.3 Sections

- **Focus and length**:
  - Keep sections **short and tightly focused**
  - Headings should describe outcomes or decisions, not be cryptic or jokey
    - ✅ Good: "Choosing the Right Plan", "Setting Up Your Account", "Troubleshooting Sync Problems"
    - ❌ Avoid: "The Plan Conundrum", "Account Adventures", "When Things Go Bump"
  - Avoid sections that run more than **2–3 pages of continuous prose** without lists or sub-breaks

- **Use of lists**:
  - **Numbered lists**: for processes, procedures, and sequences
  - **Bulleted lists**: for options, examples, pros/cons, feature lists, and checklists
  - Break long explanations into smaller paragraphs and lists wherever possible to aid scanning

---

## 3. Voice, Tone, and Sentence-Level Style

### 3.1 Person & Address

- Use **second person**: "you", "your"
- Avoid impersonal forms like "the user" or "one"
- Example: "You press the button" not "The user presses the button" or "One presses the button"

### 3.2 Tone

- **Friendly and direct**, as if speaking to an intelligent friend who's new to the topic
- **Non-patronizing**: Explain without talking down
- Keep an encouraging, problem-solving focus: Reassure readers they can succeed

### 3.3 Sentence & Word Choice

- Prefer **short sentences** and **plain words**
- If a simpler everyday synonym exists, choose it
- Avoid long chains of clauses connected by multiple "and"/"which"
- Example: "You click Save. The file appears in your folder." not "You click Save and then the file appears in your folder, which means it's been stored successfully."

### 3.4 Jargon

- Introduce jargon **only when necessary**
- **Define immediately** in simple language at first use:
  - Example: "A widget is a small on-screen tool that lets you quickly access X."
- Use consistent terminology once introduced

### 3.5 Humour

- Light, occasional humour is acceptable
- Prioritize clarity and usefulness; avoid in-jokes, sarcasm, or anything that dates quickly
- When in doubt, skip the joke

### 3.6 Avoid

- Long, abstract introductions that delay getting to the point
- Heavy theory front-loaded before the reader can do anything practical
- Dense, unbroken paragraphs

### 3.7 Concrete Drafting Rules

- **Paragraphs**: typically **2–5 sentences**
- **Contractions**: Use ("you'll", "you're", "don't") to keep the tone conversational
- **Voice**: Prefer **active voice**:
  - ✅ "You press the button" 
  - ❌ "The button is pressed"
- **Clarity checks**: Each sentence should move the explanation forward or help the reader act; cut filler

## 4. Icon-Style Callouts (TIP, REMEMBER, WARNING, TECHNICAL STUFF)

### 4.1 Purpose

- These callouts flag important or optional information without interrupting the main flow
- In manuscript, they are marked in **plain text**, to be mapped to Wiley's icons later

### 4.2 Format

- Write in all caps at the start of a new line or paragraph, followed by a colon:
  - `TIP:`
  - `REMEMBER:`
  - `WARNING:`
  - `TECHNICAL STUFF:`

### 4.3 Definitions & Usage

#### TIP
- **What it is**: A shortcut, optimization, or neat extra that is helpful but not essential
- **When to use**: When you have a "nice to know" that makes life easier
- **Example pattern**: 
  ```
  TIP: If you're short on time, start with the Basic view. You can switch to Advanced later without losing your work.
  ```

#### REMEMBER
- **What it is**: A key concept or rule the reader must not forget
- **When to use**: For critical information that affects future decisions
- **Example pattern**: 
  ```
  REMEMBER: You can always undo this change later, so don't be afraid to experiment.
  ```

#### WARNING
- **What it is**: Risks, common mistakes, or actions that can break things, waste time, or cost money
- **When to use**: When something could cause real problems if ignored
- **Example pattern**: 
  ```
  WARNING: Don't delete this folder unless you've backed it up. Once it's gone, your previous projects are gone with it.
  ```

#### TECHNICAL STUFF
- **What it is**: Optional deeper explanation or under-the-hood detail
- **When to use**: For readers who want to understand "why" or "how it works" but others can skip
- **Example pattern**: 
  ```
  TECHNICAL STUFF: Under the hood, the app stores your settings in a small database file that syncs with the cloud.
  ```

### 4.4 Per-Chapter Guidance

- Aim for approximately:
  - **2–3 TIPs**
  - **1–2 WARNINGs**
  - **1–2 REMEMBERs**
  - **0–2 TECHNICAL STUFF** blocks (depending on how technical the chapter is)
- Place callouts near the relevant step or concept, not in a separate "miscellaneous" section

## 5. Presenting Procedures, Concepts, and Examples

### 5.1 Procedures (How-to Tasks)

- **List format**: Use **numbered lists** for multi-step tasks
- **Step wording**: Each step describes **one clear action**
  - Begin each step with a **verb** (imperative form)
  - Examples: "Open", "Click", "Type", "Select", "Choose", "Save"
  - Put the **action first**, then any brief explanation

- **Example pattern**:
  ```
  1. Open the X app on your computer.
     This brings you to the home screen where you can see your recent files.
  
  2. Click the New Project button on the home screen.
     A new project window appears.
  
  3. Type a name for your project in the Name box.
     Choose something you'll recognize later.
  
  4. Click Create to finish setting up the project.
     The app creates your project and opens it for editing.
  ```

- **Complex steps**: If a step becomes long, break it into:
  - Main action in the numbered step
  - Short supporting details in a sentence or bullet list under that step

### 5.2 Concept Explanations

- **Core rhythm**:
  1. **What it is**: Give a plain-English definition
  2. **Why it matters / where it shows up**: Explain relevance in real tasks
  3. **One concrete example**: Show it in action with a small, realistic scenario

- **Clarity before metaphor**: 
  - State the literal definition first
  - Use metaphors or analogies **after** the clear explanation, to deepen understanding, not replace it

- **Focus**: Limit each explanation to what a beginner needs to recognize and use the concept. Cross-link to procedures or sections where the reader applies it

### 5.3 Examples

- **Characteristics**:
  - Realistic, grounded in situations a beginner might actually face
  - Use small, tidy numbers and simple setups
  - Avoid flashy or obscure brand references unless the topic specifically depends on them

- **Relevance**: Tie examples directly to actions the reader can perform in the software, tool, or context you're describing. Where possible, reuse a small stable set of example names, files, or scenarios throughout a chapter to reduce cognitive load

## 6. House Style Cheat-Sheet (For Proposals and Internal Use)

**Proposed Working Style for `[Your Topic] For Dummies`**

- **Audience**: Motivated beginners with little prior knowledge of `[topic]`, comfortable with basic computing but new to this subject
- **Voice**: Second-person ("you"), friendly, reassuring, and non-patronizing; plain English, short sentences, and active voice
- **Structure**: 4–6 Parts. Each chapter focuses on a single theme and is written to be "dippable" (can be read out of order). Chapters use brief intros, 3–6 clearly headed sections, numbered steps for procedures, and bullets for options, tips, and checklists
- **Icons / Callouts**: TIP, REMEMBER, WARNING, and TECHNICAL STUFF marked in text for later mapping to Wiley's standard icon set
- **Conventions**:
  - Consistent spelling (UK or US, as agreed with editor)
  - Define jargon at first use, in plain language
  - Prefer examples, checklists, and step-by-step instructions over theoretical exposition
  - Minimal footnotes; integrate essential information into the main text
- **Compliance**: This working style is designed to align with the For Dummies brand. Final manuscript will follow Wiley's official templates and in-house style guide in full once provided
