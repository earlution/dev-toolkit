# For Dummies Author Checklist

**Quick Reference Checklist for Authors**

Use this checklist when drafting chapters to ensure consistency with the For Dummies style guide.

---

## Book-Level Checks

- [ ] **Title** follows `X For Dummies` pattern
- [ ] **Audience** clearly defined as motivated beginners
- [ ] **Parts**: 4–6 Parts, each with a clear outcome-based focus
- [ ] **Part names** are functional and reader-oriented (not clever or abstract)

---

## Chapter-Level Checks

Each chapter should have:

- [ ] **One central theme or problem** that the chapter tackles
- [ ] **Short introduction (1–3 paragraphs)** that:
  - States what the chapter covers
  - Explains why the reader should care
- [ ] **3–6 sections** with:
  - Clear, outcome-based headings (describe what reader can do/decide)
  - At least one numbered procedure (step-by-step task)
- [ ] **Callouts** distributed throughout:
  - 2–3 TIPs
  - 1–2 WARNINGs
  - 1–2 REMEMBERs
  - 0–2 TECHNICAL STUFF blocks (as appropriate)
- [ ] **Optional wrap-up** (1–2 paragraphs) summarizing key takeaways
- [ ] **Dippability**: Chapter can be read standalone without requiring all previous chapters

---

## Section-Level Checks

Each section should:

- [ ] Be **short and focused** (avoid sections longer than 2–3 pages of continuous prose)
- [ ] Have a **descriptive heading** that describes outcomes or decisions
- [ ] Use **lists** to break up long explanations:
  - Numbered lists for procedures/sequences
  - Bulleted lists for options/examples/pros-cons
- [ ] Include **concrete examples** that are realistic and beginner-friendly

---

## Style & Tone Checks

- [ ] Written in **second person** ("you", "your")
- [ ] Uses **plain language**—if a simpler synonym exists, use it
- [ ] **Short paragraphs** (typically 2–5 sentences)
- [ ] **Short sentences**—avoid long chains of clauses
- [ ] Uses **contractions** ("you'll", "you're", "don't") for conversational tone
- [ ] Prefers **active voice**: "You press the button" not "The button is pressed"
- [ ] **Jargon** is:
  - Introduced only when necessary
  - Defined immediately in plain language at first use
- [ ] **Humour** (if any) is light and doesn't sacrifice clarity
- [ ] **Encouraging tone**—reassures readers they can succeed

---

## Content Handling Checks

### Procedures (How-tos)

- [ ] Use **numbered lists** for multi-step tasks
- [ ] Each step starts with a **verb** (imperative form)
- [ ] Each step describes **one clear action**
- [ ] Action comes first, then brief explanation if needed

### Concept Explanations

- [ ] Follows the rhythm:
  1. What it is (plain-English definition)
  2. Why it matters / where it shows up
  3. One concrete example
- [ ] Definition comes before metaphor (if metaphor is used)

### Examples

- [ ] Examples are **realistic** and grounded in beginner scenarios
- [ ] Use **small, tidy numbers** in worked examples
- [ ] Avoid obscure brand references unless necessary
- [ ] Examples tie directly to actions the reader can perform

---

## Callout Checks

### TIP
- [ ] Marks shortcuts, optimizations, or helpful extras (not essential)
- [ ] Format: `TIP: [text]` at start of paragraph/line

### REMEMBER
- [ ] Marks key concepts or rules reader must not forget
- [ ] Format: `REMEMBER: [text]` at start of paragraph/line

### WARNING
- [ ] Marks risks, common mistakes, or things that can break/waste time/cost money
- [ ] Format: `WARNING: [text]` at start of paragraph/line

### TECHNICAL STUFF
- [ ] Marks optional deeper explanations (can be skipped)
- [ ] Format: `TECHNICAL STUFF: [text]` at start of paragraph/line

---

## What to Avoid

- [ ] Long, abstract introductions that delay getting to the point
- [ ] Heavy theory front-loaded before practical content
- [ ] Dense, unbroken paragraphs (walls of text)
- [ ] Impersonal language ("the user", "one")
- [ ] Patronizing tone
- [ ] In-jokes or sarcasm
- [ ] Clever or cryptic headings
- [ ] Assuming reader has read all previous chapters (make chapters dippable)

---

## Final Review Questions

Before submitting a chapter, ask:

1. **Can a reader jump to this chapter** and still understand it? (Dippability)
2. **Does each section** help the reader do something or make a decision?
3. **Are procedures** clear enough that a beginner could follow them?
4. **Is the tone** friendly and encouraging, not intimidating?
5. **Would a smart beginner** feel "I can do this" after reading?
6. **Are examples** realistic and relatable?
7. **Is jargon** defined when first introduced?
8. **Are callouts** placed near relevant content, not randomly?

---
