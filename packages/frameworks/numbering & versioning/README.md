## Core Versioning Schema

**Format:** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`

- **RC:** Release Candidate (0 = development, 1+ = release candidate)
- **EPIC:** Epic number (e.g., 15)
- **STORY:** Story number within epic (e.g., 1)
- **TASK:** Task number within story (e.g., 4)
- **BUILD:** Build number (increments per release within task)

**Example:** `0.15.1.4+2` = Development, Epic 15, Story 1, Task 4, Build 2

## Epic Renumbering Strategy

**Problem:** Having both old (`RC.EPIC.STORY.PATCH`) and new (`RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`) version formats within the same epic creates confusion and version collisions.

**Solution:** Complete legacy epics with old format, then start new epics with new format exclusively.

**Epic Ranges:**
- **Epic 1-9:** Legacy format (`RC.EPIC.STORY.PATCH`) - Grandfathered, immutable
- **Epic 10+:** New format (`RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`) - Fresh start, clean version space

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation between legacy and new formats
- No version collisions
- Fresh start for new epics
- Clear branch strategy (`epic/10-*`, `epic/11-*`, etc.)

## Key Principles

1. **Version numbers are canonical** - They determine ordering, not timestamps
2. **Parallel epic development** - Each epic maintains its own version stream
3. **Forensic traceability** - Complete accountability through version ↔ epic/story/task ↔ changelogs ↔ kanban markers
4. **Immutability** - Historical metadata is preserved as-is
5. **Epic branch workflow** - Always work on epic branches (`epic/{n}-...`), never directly on `main`

## Related Documentation

These policies are part of a larger system of interconnected documents:
- **[Versioning Quick Reference](../../../KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/versioning-quick-reference.md)** - 1-2 page summary for quick lookup ⚡ *(Dev-kit specific)*
- **[Dual-Versioning Guide](../../../KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dual-versioning-package-managers.md)** - Managing `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` + SemVer for package managers ⚠️ *(Dev-kit specific)*
- **Cursor Rules** (`.cursorrules`) - Fundamental system rules that enforce versioning requirements *(Project-specific)*
- **Release Workflow Reference** - Automated implementation of versioning schema *(see workflow mgt package)*
- **Release Workflow Agent Execution Guide** - Step-by-step agent execution patterns *(see workflow mgt package)*

**Note:** Some references point to project-specific files. When implementing in other projects, see `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for customization instructions.

**⚠️ Package Manager Compatibility:** If your project uses package managers (npm, pub.dev, PyPI, etc.) that require Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), see the [Dual-Versioning Guide](../../../KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dual-versioning-package-managers.md) for mapping strategies and implementation patterns.

## Usage

These documents should be referenced when:
- Creating new epics, stories, or tasks
- Determining version numbers for releases
- Understanding version progression rules
- Implementing versioning in other projects
- Setting up numbering systems for learning outcomes or other domain objects
- Planning epic renumbering strategies

## Consumption Pattern for Other Projects

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Copy, Don't Reference

**Projects MUST copy versioning policies from `ai-dev-kit`, not link to them.**

**Why Copy?**
- Projects need to customize Epic/Story/Task ranges, file paths, and terminology
- Projects evolve independently and may need project-specific adaptations
- Copying ensures projects have full control over their versioning policies
- Prevents breaking changes in `ai-dev-kit` from affecting consuming projects

**What to Copy:**
1. **Core Policy Documents:**
   - `versioning-policy.md` - Copy and customize Epic ranges, file paths
   - `versioning-strategy.md` - Copy as-is (concepts are universal)
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Copy and customize for your project

2. **Templates:**
   - `EPIC_TEMPLATE.md` - Copy to your templates directory
   - `STORY_TEMPLATE.md` - Copy to your templates directory

3. **Validation Scripts** (if using workflow package):
   - `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_branch_context.py`
   - `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_changelog_format.py`

### Customization Boundaries

**✅ What You CAN Customize:**
- Epic ranges (e.g., Epic 1-9 legacy, Epic 10+ new format)
- File paths (version file location, changelog directories)
- Project names and terminology
- Work item structure (if different from Epic/Story/Task)
- CI/CD integration points
- Validation script locations

**❌ What You MUST Keep:**
- **Schema format:** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` structure
- **Validation rules:** Version format validation, changelog format requirements
- **Core principles:** Canonical ordering, immutability rules, traceability grid
- **Date formats:** `DD-MM-YY` for main changelog, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC` for detailed changelog

### Update Process

**How to Stay Aligned with Framework Updates:**

1. **Monitor `ai-dev-kit` for updates:**
   - Watch for new versions of framework packages
   - Review changelog for versioning framework changes

2. **Review updates:**
   - Compare updated framework policies with your copied policies
   - Identify new patterns, principles, or best practices
   - Assess relevance to your project

3. **Selectively adopt:**
   - Copy new sections that are relevant
   - Adapt new patterns to your project context
   - Update your policy documents incrementally

4. **Maintain your customizations:**
   - Preserve project-specific Epic ranges
   - Keep your file paths and terminology
   - Maintain your project-specific adaptations

**Example Update Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Review changes in ai-dev-kit
git clone https://github.com/earlution/ai-dev-kit.git
cd ai-dev-kit
git log --oneline packages/frameworks/numbering\ \&\ versioning/

# 2. Compare with your copied policies
diff -u your-project/docs/versioning/versioning-policy.md \
         ai-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/numbering\ \&\ versioning/versioning-policy.md

# 3. Selectively merge relevant changes
# (Manual process - review each change)
```

### Single Source of Truth Relationship

**`ai-dev-kit` is the canonical source of truth (SoT) for:**
- Versioning schema definition (`RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`)
- Core versioning principles (canonical ordering, immutability, traceability)
- Best practices and patterns
- Validation requirements

**Your project's copied policies are:**
- **Adaptations** of the framework for your specific context
- **Customized** with your Epic ranges, paths, and terminology
- **Independent** - can evolve separately from framework
- **Aligned** - should reference framework as source of truth

**Documentation Pattern:**
```markdown
# Your Project Versioning Policy

**Based on:** ai-dev-kit `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/versioning-policy.md`  
**Last Synced:** 2025-12-02  
**Customizations:** Epic 1-9 legacy range, custom file paths

[Your customized content here]
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Copy Framework Files:**
   ```bash
   # Copy core policies
   cp ai-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/numbering\ \&\ versioning/versioning-policy.md your-project/docs/versioning/
   cp ai-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/numbering\ \&\ versioning/versioning-strategy.md your-project/docs/versioning/
   cp ai-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/numbering\ \&\ versioning/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md your-project/docs/versioning/
   ```

2. **Customize for Your Project:**
   - Update Epic ranges (if different from 1-9 legacy, 10+ new)
   - Update file paths (version file, changelog directories)
   - Update project names and terminology
   - Update work item structure (if different)

3. **Set Up Version File:**
   - Create `src/{your-project}/version.py`
   - Follow framework pattern (component-based structure)
   - Use your project's Epic/Story/Task numbers

4. **Set Up Changelog Structure:**
   - Create `CHANGELOG.md` (main summary)
   - Create `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE/` directory (detailed changelogs)
   - Follow framework format (`DD-MM-YY` for main, full timestamp for archive)

5. **Create Validation Scripts:**
   - Copy validation scripts from workflow package (if using)
   - Customize paths for your project
   - Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline

6. **Document Your Customizations:**
   - Create a "Customizations" section in your policy
   - Document what you changed and why
   - Reference framework as source of truth

### Example: New Project Setup

**Scenario:** Setting up versioning for a new project called "myapp"

1. **Copy framework:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p myapp/docs/versioning
   cp ai-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/numbering\ \&\ versioning/*.md myapp/docs/versioning/
   ```

2. **Customize `versioning-policy.md`:**
   - Change Epic ranges: "Epic 1+ uses new format" (no legacy range)
   - Change file paths: `src/myapp/version.py`
   - Change examples: Use `0.1.1.1+1` instead of `0.9.21.3+1`

3. **Create version file:**
   ```python
   # src/myapp/version.py
   VERSION_RC = 0
   VERSION_EPIC = 1
   VERSION_STORY = 1
   VERSION_TASK = 1
   VERSION_BUILD = 1
   VERSION_STRING = f"{VERSION_RC}.{VERSION_EPIC}.{VERSION_STORY}.{VERSION_TASK}+{VERSION_BUILD}"
   ```

4. **Set up changelog:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p myapp/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE
   touch myapp/CHANGELOG.md
   ```

5. **Document customizations:**
   ```markdown
   # MyApp Versioning Policy

   **Based on:** ai-dev-kit versioning framework  
   **Customizations:**
   - Epic 1+ uses new format (no legacy range)
   - Version file: `src/myapp/version.py`
   - Changelog archive: `CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE/`
   ```
