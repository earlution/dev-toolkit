# Kanban Governance Policy

**Owner:** Product Ops
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-26
**Applies To:** All work streams
**Portable Package:** This document is part of a portable numbering & versioning policy package

**Note:** This document contains references to Confidentia-specific paths and structures. When implementing in other projects, customize file paths, project names, and work item terminology. See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed customization instructions.

---

## Purpose

A single, authoritative policy describing how to run Kanban with versioning integration.

**Key Components:**
- Defines work-item types (Epic → Story → Task) and how they map to Git artifacts
- Establishes documentation, numbering, and versioning requirements
- Links rituals (board usage, stand-ups, release workflow) to documentation
- Integrates versioning schema with work item structure

**Foundation:** This policy is underpinned by project-specific rules (e.g., `.cursorrules` in Confidentia), which are fundamental to the entire system. When implementing in other projects, adapt this to your project's rule system.

---

## The Harmonious Cycle

Work flows in perfect harmony:

```
Task (Kanban)
  → defines what to do
    → Version (RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD)
      → tracks the work
        → Release Workflow
          → implements both policies
            → Kanban Update
              → records the version (forensic marker)
                → Repeat
```

**Principle:** All substantive work MUST be task-driven.
If work doesn't map to a task, the Kanban needs updating.

---

## Board Structure

Five columns, left to right:

1. **Backlog** – Groomed but unscheduled
2. **Ready** – Fully specified, awaiting prioritisation
3. **In Progress** – Active work with branch
4. **Verify** – Done, awaiting validation
5. **Done** – Released, tagged, validated

**Rules:**
- Move strictly left → right (no skipping)
- WIP limits per swimlane
- Every card links to KB doc and branch/tag

---

## Work Items

### Epics

Governing artifact for a feature set or maintenance theme.

- **Location:** `docs/epics/Epic-XX.md` or `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/epics/overview/Epic XX/Epic-XX.md` *(customize path)*
- **Branch:** `epic/<number>-<slug>`
- **Version:** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` (where EPIC = epic number)
- **Template:** `EPIC_TEMPLATE.md` *(in this package)* or `docs/templates/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md` *(customize path)*

### Stories

Decompose epic scope into releasable slices.

- **Location:** `docs/stories/Story-N-Title.md` or `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/stories/overview/Epic XX/Story-N-Title.md` *(customize path)*
- **Numbering:** `E<epic>S<story>` (e.g., `E20S7`)
- **Template:** `STORY_TEMPLATE.md` *(in this package)* or `docs/templates/STORY_TEMPLATE.md` *(customize path)*

### Tasks

Atomic units inside a story.

- **Numbering:** `Exx:Sxx:Txx` (Epic, Story, Task with zero padding)
- **Example:** `E20:S07:T10` = Epic 20, Story 7, Task 10
- **Documented:** Input / Deliverable / Dependencies / Blocker / Parallel Development Candidacy
- **Tracked:** Git commits reference task ID

---

## Versioning

### Schema

**Format:** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`

- **RC:** Release Candidate (0 = development, 1+ = release candidate)
- **EPIC:** Epic number
- **STORY:** Story number within epic
- **TASK:** Task number within story
- **BUILD:** Build number (increments per release within task)

**Example:** `0.20.11.15+1` = Development, Epic 20, Story 11, Task 15, Build 1

**Related Documentation:**
- **[Versioning Policy (Schema)](versioning-policy.md)** - Complete schema definition
- **[Versioning Strategy](versioning-strategy.md)** - Forensic traceability and canonical ordering principles
- **[Implementation Guide](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Step-by-step guide for implementing in other projects

### Task-Level Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All substantive work MUST be task-driven.

**Version TASK number must match active task.**

**Requirements:**
1. Version TASK reflects the active task
   - Working on `E20:S11:T016` → version `0.20.11.16+B`
   - TASK component aligns with Kanban task

2. Task transitions use `--task` parameter
   - New task: `--task N` in release workflow
   - Resets BUILD to 1, sets TASK to N

3. BUILD resets to 1 with new task
   - BUILD increments within same task
   - BUILD does NOT carry over between tasks

4. Validation enforces alignment
   - Release workflow validates task exists
   - Validators check task/version alignment
   - Pre-commit hooks enforce alignment

**Example:** See implementation guide for example story documents *(customize path structure)*

---

## Release Workflow

The process that implements both policies (Kanban Governance and Versioning Strategy).

**Reference:** See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for release workflow integration details

**Documents:**
1. Version File (`src/confidentia/version.py`)
2. Detailed Changelog (`CHANGELOG_vRC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD.md`)
3. Main Changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`)
4. README (`README.md`)
5. Epic Doc (auto-updated)
6. Story Docs (auto-updated)
7. Kanban Board (auto-updated)
8. Branch Context Validator
9. Changelog Format Validator
10. Kanban Update Module

**Process:**
1. Version Bump
   - `--task N` sets task (resets BUILD to 1)
   - `--story N` sets story (resets TASK and BUILD to 1)
   - Otherwise increments BUILD on current task
   - Validates task exists and version TASK matches

2. Changelog Creation
   - Detailed changelog with full timestamp
   - Main CHANGELOG.md with summary

3. Kanban Auto-Update
   - Updates epic/story docs with version and summary
   - Updates completed tasks with version numbers
   - Updates Kanban board entry
   - Validates forensic markers were added

4. Validation
   - Branch context (epic ↔ version ↔ changelog, task/version alignment)
   - Changelog format (timestamp)
   - Task exists in story doc
   - Version TASK matches provided task

5. Git Operations
   - Stage all files
   - Commit with version in message
   - Create annotated tag
   - Push to remote

---

## Documentation

**Epics** reference:
- Branch name, version schema, story checklist, dependencies, risks

**Stories** include:
- Task index aligning with E#S#T# numbering
- Goals and acceptance criteria
- Completion summary before release

**Tasks** capture:
- Cross-team impacts (Parallel Development Candidacy)
- Staging plan if spanning multiple PRs

**Templates:**
- New epic/story from templates
- Deviations need Product Ops approval

---

## Rules

1. **Traceability:** Every board card links to KB doc, branch/tag, changelog entry
2. **Single Source of Truth:** KB docs are canonical
3. **Gate Conditions:**
   - Ready → In Progress: Story doc complete, blockers resolved, branch created
   - In Progress → Verify: Tasks checked, summary drafted, dry-run done
   - Verify → Done: Release workflow executed, tag pushed, KB doc accepted
4. **Numbering Discipline:** No duplicate IDs; IDs never reused
5. **WIP & Ownership:** Each story has named DRI; pause >48h moves back to Ready
