## 📖 Overview

This document provides a **step-by-step agent execution guide** for the Refactor Workflow. The Refactor Workflow demonstrates how to apply the agent-driven execution pattern to code quality workflows.

**This guide shows exactly how an AI agent should analyze, determine, execute, validate, and proceed through each of the 13 Refactor Workflow steps.**

> **Note on Examples:** This document includes project-agnostic examples. When adopting this workflow in your own project, replace all examples with your project-specific paths, commands, and structures.

## 🎯 Execution Context

### Workflow Definition

**Workflow:** Refactor Workflow
**Type:** `refactor`
**Steps:** 13 steps organized into 4 phases:
- **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Steps 1-2)**
- **Phase 2: Execution (Steps 3-4)**
- **Phase 3: Validation (Steps 5-7)**
- **Phase 4: Documentation & Git Operations (Steps 8-13)**

**Canonical Example:** No - this is an example workflow based on the Release Workflow pattern

### Agent Execution Pattern

For each step, the agent follows this pattern:
1. **ANALYZE** - Understand step requirements and context
2. **DETERMINE** - Decide what actions to take
3. **EXECUTE** - Perform the actions
4. **VALIDATE** - Verify execution succeeded
5. **PROCEED** - Document and move to next step

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Progress Tracking with Cursor TODOs

**REQUIRED:** Agents **MUST** use `todo_write` to create and maintain a TODO list tracking all 13 Refactor Workflow steps. This is **NOT OPTIONAL** - it is a mandatory requirement for Refactor Workflow execution.

**Required Implementation Pattern:**

1. **At Workflow Start (MANDATORY):** Create TODO list with all 13 steps as `pending`
2. **Before Each Step (MANDATORY):** Mark step as `in_progress`
3. **After Each Step (MANDATORY):** Mark step as `completed` and mark next step as `in_progress`
4. **On Completion (MANDATORY):** All steps marked as `completed`

## Step-by-Step Execution Guide

### Step 1: Analyze Current Code Structure

**Purpose:** Understand the current code structure before refactoring

**Agent Actions:**

1. **ANALYZE:**
   - Read workflow parameters (target_module, refactor_type)
   - Identify target files and directories
   - Understand code structure and dependencies
   - Review existing tests and documentation

2. **DETERMINE:**
   - Determine analysis scope
   - Identify key components to analyze
   - Plan analysis approach

3. **EXECUTE:**
   - Analyze code structure
   - Identify dependencies
   - Document current state
   - Create analysis report

4. **VALIDATE:**
   - Verify analysis is complete
   - Check analysis report is accurate
   - Confirm all dependencies identified

5. **PROCEED:**
   - Document analysis results
   - Pass analysis to Step 2
   - Mark Step 1 as complete

**Example Analysis:**
```python
# Agent analyzes target module
target_module = "src/utils/validation.py"
analysis = {
    "files": ["src/utils/validation.py", "src/utils/validators.py"],
    "dependencies": ["src/core/types.py", "src/core/errors.py"],
    "complexity": "medium",
    "test_coverage": "85%",
    "issues": ["long functions", "duplicated logic"]
}
```

### Step 2: Plan Refactoring Approach

**Purpose:** Create a detailed plan for the refactoring

**Agent Actions:**

1. **ANALYZE:**
   - Review analysis from Step 1
   - Understand refactoring type and goals
   - Consider constraints (preserve functionality, test coverage)

2. **DETERMINE:**
   - Determine refactoring strategy
   - Plan specific refactoring steps
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies

3. **EXECUTE:**
   - Create refactoring plan document
   - Define refactoring steps
   - Document expected outcomes
   - Create rollback plan

4. **VALIDATE:**
   - Verify plan is complete
   - Check plan addresses all issues
   - Confirm plan is feasible

5. **PROCEED:**
   - Document refactoring plan
   - Pass plan to Step 3
   - Mark Step 2 as complete

**Example Plan:**
```markdown
# Refactoring Plan

## Target: src/utils/validation.py

## Issues Identified:
- Long functions (>50 lines)
- Duplicated validation logic
- Missing type hints

## Refactoring Steps:
1. Extract validation functions into separate module
2. Add type hints to all functions
