# Agent-Driven Workflow Execution Methodology

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-01
**Related:** Epic 21 - Visual Workflow Management Platform, Release Workflow

---

## 📖 Overview

This document defines the **intelligent agent-driven workflow execution pattern** for VWMP workflows. Unlike deterministic script execution, agent-driven execution involves AI agents analyzing each workflow step, determining appropriate actions, and executing with intelligent decision-making.

**Key Principle:** Workflows are executed by intelligent agents that analyze context, make decisions, and take actions—not by deterministic scripts that blindly follow predefined steps.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

### Agent-Driven vs. Deterministic Execution

**Deterministic Script Execution:**
- Scripts execute predefined commands in sequence
- No analysis or decision-making required
- Same inputs always produce same outputs
- Example: `python scripts/automation/release_workflow.py --auto-go`

**Agent-Driven Execution:**
- AI agent analyzes each step's requirements
- Agent determines appropriate actions based on context
- Agent makes intelligent decisions at each step
- Agent validates and adapts as needed
- Example: Agent reads workflow definition, analyzes Step 1 requirements, determines next version, updates version file, then proceeds to Step 2

### Why Agent-Driven?

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Contextual Intelligence:** Agent understands project state, branch context, and requirements
- ✅ **Adaptive Execution:** Agent can handle edge cases and make decisions
- ✅ **Error Recovery:** Agent can analyze failures and determine recovery strategies
- ✅ **Validation:** Agent validates each step before proceeding
- ✅ **Documentation:** Agent can explain decisions and document reasoning

**Use Cases:**
- Complex workflows requiring analysis (e.g., Release Workflow)
- Workflows with conditional logic based on project state
- Workflows requiring intelligent error handling
- Workflows where context matters (branch, version, dependencies)

---

## 📋 Execution Pattern

### The Agent Execution Cycle

For each workflow step, the agent follows this pattern:

```
1. ANALYZE
   ├─ Read step definition and requirements
   ├─ Understand step purpose and dependencies
   ├─ Gather context (project state, previous step outputs)
   └─ Identify what needs to be done

2. DETERMINE
   ├─ Determine specific actions required
   ├─ Calculate values (e.g., next version number)
   ├─ Validate prerequisites are met
   └─ Plan execution approach

3. EXECUTE
   ├─ Perform the required actions
   ├─ Update files, run commands, create resources
   └─ Capture results and outputs

4. VALIDATE
   ├─ Verify execution succeeded
   ├─ Check outputs match expectations
   ├─ Validate against requirements
   └─ Handle errors if validation fails

5. PROCEED
   ├─ Document what was done
   ├─ Pass outputs to next steps
   └─ Move to next step in workflow
```

### Example: Step 1 Analysis

**Step Definition:**
```yaml
- id: step-1
  name: Bump Version
  handler: release.version_bump
  config:
    version_file: src/confidentia/version.py
    increment_type: patch
```

**Agent Analysis:**
1. **ANALYZE:** Read current version from `src/confidentia/version.py`, understand version schema (RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD), check branch context
2. **DETERMINE:** Calculate next version (increment BUILD), validate version matches branch schema
3. **EXECUTE:** Update version file with new version
4. **VALIDATE:** Verify version file updated correctly, check version format is valid
5. **PROCEED:** Pass new version to Step 2, document version change

## 🔄 Workflow Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Preparation

**Agent Actions:**
1. Load workflow definition (YAML)
2. Parse workflow structure and steps
3. Validate workflow definition
4. Extract workflow parameters
5. Understand step dependencies
6. Resolve execution order

### Phase 2: Step-by-Step Execution

For each step in execution order:

1. **Step Analysis:**
   - Read step definition
   - Understand step purpose
   - Check dependencies are satisfied
   - Gather required context

2. **Action Determination:**
   - Determine what needs to be done
   - Calculate required values
   - Plan execution approach
   - Validate prerequisites

3. **Execution:**
   - Perform step actions
   - Update files/systems
   - Run commands/scripts
   - Create resources

4. **Validation:**
   - Verify step succeeded
   - Check outputs
   - Validate against requirements
   - Handle errors

5. **Documentation:**
   - Record what was done
   - Capture outputs
   - Document decisions
   - Update status

### Phase 3: Completion

**Agent Actions:**
1. Verify all steps completed
2. Collect final results
3. Generate execution summary
4. Report completion status

## 📊 Progress Tracking with Cursor TODOs

**🚨 MANDATORY: Use Cursor's TODO feature for agent-managed workflow progress tracking**

For **all agent-managed workflows**, agents **MUST** use `todo_write` to create and maintain a TODO list tracking all workflow steps. This is **REQUIRED**, not optional.

**Why TODOs are Required for Agent-Managed Workflows:**
- ✅ **User Visibility:** User can see real-time progress through all workflow steps
- ✅ **Agent Organization:** Helps agent stay organized across sequential steps
- ✅ **Error Recovery:** Clear visibility into where execution stopped if interrupted
- ✅ **User Transparency:** User can verify all steps completed successfully
- ✅ **Status Management:** Automatic status updates provide clear execution state
- ✅ **Accountability:** Provides audit trail of workflow execution
- ✅ **Interruption Handling:** If workflow is interrupted, user can see exactly where it stopped

**Required Implementation Pattern:**

1. **At Workflow Start (MANDATORY):** Create TODO list with all steps as `pending`
   ```python
   todo_write(merge=False, todos=[
       {'id': 'step-1', 'status': 'pending', 'content': 'Step 1: Description'},
       {'id': 'step-2', 'status': 'pending', 'content': 'Step 2: Description'},
       # ... all workflow steps
   ])
   ```

2. **Before Each Step (MANDATORY):** Mark step as `in_progress`
   ```python
   todo_write(merge=True, todos=[
       {'id': 'step-1', 'status': 'in_progress'}
   ])
   ```

3. **After Each Step (MANDATORY):** Mark step as `completed` and mark next step as `in_progress`
   ```python
   todo_write(merge=True, todos=[
       {'id': 'step-1', 'status': 'completed'},
       {'id': 'step-2', 'status': 'in_progress'}
   ])
   ```

4. **On Completion (MANDATORY):** All steps marked as `completed`
   ```python
   todo_write(merge=True, todos=[
       {'id': 'step-N', 'status': 'completed'}
   ])
   ```

**Enforcement Rules:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** execute agent-managed workflows without creating TODO list first
- ❌ **DO NOT** skip TODO updates between steps
- ✅ **MUST** create TODO list before first step execution
- ✅ **MUST** update TODO status before and after each step
- ✅ **MUST** mark all steps as completed on successful completion
- ✅ **MUST** use descriptive content for each TODO item

**When TODOs are Required:**
- ✅ **All agent-managed workflows** (workflows executed by AI agents)
- ✅ Multi-step workflows (3+ steps) - **MANDATORY**
- ✅ Workflows with sequential dependencies - **MANDATORY**
- ✅ Long-running workflows where progress visibility matters - **MANDATORY**
- ✅ Workflows where error recovery is important - **MANDATORY**

**When TODOs are Optional:**
- ⚠️ Single-step workflows (may still benefit from TODOs for consistency)
- ⚠️ Deterministic script execution (not agent-managed)

**Canonical Example:**
See [Release Workflow Agent Execution Guide](release-workflow-agent-execution.md) for a complete example using TODOs for all 10 steps. The Release Workflow demonstrates the **REQUIRED** TODO implementation pattern for agent-managed workflows.

---

## 🎓 Canonical Example: Release Workflow

The **Release Workflow** serves as the canonical example of agent-driven execution. See [Release Workflow Agent Execution Guide](release-workflow-agent-execution.md) for detailed step-by-step agent execution patterns.

**Why Release Workflow is Canonical:**
- ✅ **Complex Decision-Making:** Requires analysis of version schema, branch context, changelog format
- ✅ **Context-Dependent:** Actions depend on current project state
- ✅ **Validation-Heavy:** Multiple validation steps requiring intelligent analysis
- ✅ **Error Recovery:** Requires intelligent handling of validation failures
- ✅ **Documentation Integration:** Updates multiple documentation systems intelligently

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Don't: Blind Script Execution

**Bad:**
```python
# Agent just runs script without analysis
run_terminal_cmd("python scripts/automation/release_workflow.py --auto-go")
```

**Good:**
```python
# Agent analyzes workflow, executes each step intelligently
# Step 1: Analyze version requirements, determine next version, update file
# Step 2: Analyze changelog requirements, create detailed changelog
# etc.
```

### ❌ Don't: Skip Analysis

**Bad:**
- Agent executes step without understanding requirements
- Agent doesn't validate prerequisites
- Agent doesn't check context

**Good:**
- Agent analyzes step requirements first
- Agent validates prerequisites
- Agent checks context before executing

### ❌ Don't: Ignore Errors

**Bad:**
- Agent continues after step failure
- Agent doesn't analyze error causes
- Agent doesn't determine recovery strategy

**Good:**
- Agent analyzes errors intelligently
- Agent determines if step is required or optional
- Agent decides on recovery strategy (retry, skip, abort)
