# Testing Workflow: Agent Execution Guide

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-03
**Related:** Release Workflow (canonical example) | Agent-Driven Workflow Execution

---

## 📖 Overview

This document provides a **step-by-step agent execution guide** for the Testing Workflow. The Testing Workflow demonstrates how to apply the agent-driven execution pattern to testing workflows.

**This guide shows exactly how an AI agent should analyze, determine, execute, validate, and proceed through each of the 15 Testing Workflow steps.**

> **Note on Examples:** This document includes project-agnostic examples. When adopting this workflow in your own project, replace all examples with your project-specific paths, commands, and structures.

---

## 🎯 Execution Context

### Workflow Definition

**Workflow:** Testing Workflow
**Type:** `testing`
**Steps:** 15 steps organized into 5 phases:
- **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (Steps 1-2)**
- **Phase 2: Execution (Steps 3-4)**
- **Phase 3: Validation (Steps 5-9)**
- **Phase 4: Documentation & Git Operations (Steps 10-13)**
- **Phase 5: Verification & Results (Steps 14-15)**

**Canonical Example:** No - this is an example workflow based on the Release Workflow pattern

### Agent Execution Pattern

For each step, the agent follows this pattern:
1. **ANALYZE** - Understand step requirements and context
2. **DETERMINE** - Decide what actions to take
3. **EXECUTE** - Perform the actions
4. **VALIDATE** - Verify execution succeeded
5. **PROCEED** - Document and move to next step

### 🚨 MANDATORY: Progress Tracking with Cursor TODOs

**REQUIRED:** Agents **MUST** use `todo_write` to create and maintain a TODO list tracking all 15 Testing Workflow steps. This is **NOT OPTIONAL** - it is a mandatory requirement for Testing Workflow execution.

**Required Implementation Pattern:**

1. **At Workflow Start (MANDATORY):** Create TODO list with all 15 steps as `pending`
2. **Before Each Step (MANDATORY):** Mark step as `in_progress`
3. **After Each Step (MANDATORY):** Mark step as `completed` and mark next step as `in_progress`
4. **On Completion (MANDATORY):** All steps marked as `completed`
