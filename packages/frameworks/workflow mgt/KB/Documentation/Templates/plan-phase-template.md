## Integration with CHECK and ACT Phases

**PLAN → CHECK → ACT Flow:**

1. **PLAN Phase (Step 3):**
   - Document objectives
   - Define expected outcomes
   - Create verification plan

2. **CHECK Phase (Step 12):**
   - Verify objectives were met
   - Check expected outcomes achieved
   - Execute verification plan

3. **ACT Phase (Step 13):**
   - Act on verification results
   - Standardize successful practices
   - Create follow-up tasks if needed

**Example Integration:**

```markdown
## PLAN Phase

### Objectives
- Add Step 12 to Release Workflow

### Expected Outcomes
- Step 12 added and documented

### Verification Plan
- Review Step 12 execution guide
- Test Step 12 workflow

## CHECK Phase (Post-Commit)

### Verification Status
- **Status:** Verified ✅
- **Method:** Documentation Review
- **Date:** 2025-12-03 15:30:00 UTC

### Evaluation
- ✅ Objectives met: Step 12 added
- ✅ Expected outcomes achieved: Step 12 documented
- ✅ Verification plan completed: Guide reviewed, workflow tested

## ACT Phase

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** Objectives should be clear and specific
2. **Be Measurable:** Expected outcomes should be measurable when possible
3. **Be Realistic:** Verification plan should be achievable
4. **Link Phases:** Connect PLAN → CHECK → ACT phases
5. **Maintain Compatibility:** PLAN section is optional for backward compatibility

---

## Backward Compatibility

**PLAN section is optional:**
- Existing changelogs without PLAN section are still valid
- New changelogs should include PLAN section
- Step 3 should prompt for PLAN section but allow skipping

**Migration:**
- Existing changelogs can be updated with PLAN section
- New releases should include PLAN section
- Examples show both formats (with and without PLAN)
