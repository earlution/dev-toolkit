## Reflection Documentation Format

### Complete Reflection Example

```markdown
## CHECK Phase (Post-Commit Reflection)

### Reflection Questions

**1. Did the change work as expected?**
- ✅ Yes
- Notes: Change implemented successfully, all tests pass

**2. Did it solve the problem?**
- ✅ Yes
- Notes: Original issue resolved, no regressions observed

**3. Are there any side effects?**
- ✅ None observed
- Notes: No side effects detected during testing

**4. What did we learn?**
- The PDCA approach helps ensure changes are verified
- Explicit verification prevents false "Fixed" claims
- Reflection questions help capture lessons learned

**5. What should be adjusted?**
- None required - change successful
- Process improvement: Continue using PDCA approach
```

### Reflection with Issues Example

```markdown
## CHECK Phase (Post-Commit Reflection)

### Reflection Questions

**1. Did the change work as expected?**
- ⚠️ Partially
- Notes: Core functionality works, but edge case handling needs improvement

**2. Did it solve the problem?**
- ⚠️ Partially
- Notes: Main issue resolved, but related issue discovered

**3. Are there any side effects?**
- ⚠️ Minor side effects
- Notes: Performance slightly degraded in edge cases

**4. What did we learn?**
- Edge case testing needed before commit
- Performance testing should be part of verification
- Need better test coverage for edge cases

**5. What should be adjusted?**
- Create follow-up task for edge case fix
- Add performance testing to verification process
- Improve test coverage
```

## Integration with ACT Phase

**If Reflection Shows Success:**
- Standardize successful practices
- Document what worked
- Apply to future releases

**If Reflection Shows Issues:**
- Document what didn't work
- Create follow-up tasks
- Plan adjustments

**If Reflection Shows Learning:**
- Capture lessons learned
- Update documentation
- Share knowledge

## Best Practices

1. **Be Honest:** Answer reflection questions honestly
2. **Document Everything:** Capture all observations
3. **Learn Continuously:** Use reflection to improve
4. **Act on Results:** Use reflection to inform ACT phase
5. **Share Knowledge:** Document lessons learned for team
