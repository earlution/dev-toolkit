## Overview

Epic 6 provides the organizational structure for all Bug Report (BR) implementation work. This epic encompasses BR intake processes, BR processing workflows, bug fix patterns, and BR-related tooling. It ensures that all bug fix work originating from Bug Reports is properly tracked, prioritized, and implemented using consistent patterns and best practices.

This epic works in conjunction with Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) to provide a complete BR → Task → Story → Epic flow, ensuring that Bug Reports are properly converted to Kanban tasks and tracked through implementation.

---

## Goals

1. **Streamline BR Intake:** Establish clear processes for converting Bug Reports into Kanban tasks
2. **Enable Effective Triage:** Provide frameworks and tools for triaging and prioritizing BR implementation work
3. **Standardize Bug Fix Patterns:** Define consistent patterns and best practices for bug fixes
4. **Improve Tracking and Reporting:** Enable comprehensive tracking and reporting of BR implementation progress
5. **Automate BR Workflows:** Develop automation and tooling to streamline BR processing and implementation

## Stories

### Story 1: BR Intake and Triage Workflow

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-09 (v0.6.1.1+1 – Story 1 created)

**Goal:** Establish a clear, systematic workflow for converting incoming Bug Reports into Kanban tasks, including triage processes to assess severity and priority.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] E6:S01:T01 – Design BR intake and triage workflow process
- [ ] E6:S01:T02 – Create BR triage automation scripts
- [ ] E6:S01:T03 – Integrate BR intake with Kanban framework
- [ ] E6:S01:T04 – Document BR intake and triage process and examples

> **Format:** Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format (e.g., `E6:S01:T01`, not `T01` alone)

> **Forensic Marker Format:** `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` (e.g., `✅ COMPLETE (v0.6.1.3+1)`)  
> **Consistency:** Task checkboxes in this detailed section must match the Story file's Task Checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- BR intake and triage workflow clearly documented
- Automation scripts convert BRs to Kanban tasks
- Integration with Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) established
- Examples demonstrate complete BR → Task flow

**Parallel Development Dependencies:**
- Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) - Uses Kanban intake processes
- Epic 2 (Workflow Management) - May use workflows for automation
- *Parallel Development Candidacy:* Safe (can develop independently)

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- None

**Blocked By:**
- None

**Coordinates With:**
- **Epic 4 (Kanban Framework):** Uses Kanban intake processes to convert BRs to tasks
- **Epic 2 (Workflow Management):** May use workflows for BR processing automation
- **Epic 3 (Versioning):** Tracks bug fixes with version markers

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** BR intake process may become bottleneck if not properly automated  
  **Mitigation:** Develop automation early (Story 5) and integrate with existing workflows

- **Risk:** Lack of triage framework may lead to critical bugs being missed  
  **Mitigation:** Establish triage framework early (Story 1) and integrate with prioritization

- **Risk:** Inconsistent bug fix patterns may reduce code quality or introduce regressions  
  **Mitigation:** Document patterns and best practices (Story 3) and provide examples
