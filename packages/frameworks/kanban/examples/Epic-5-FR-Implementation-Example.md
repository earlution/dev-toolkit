## Overview

Epic 5 provides the organizational structure for all Feature Request (FR) implementation work. This epic encompasses FR intake processes, FR processing workflows, FR implementation patterns, and FR-related tooling. It ensures that all feature development work originating from Feature Requests is properly tracked, prioritized, and implemented using consistent patterns and best practices.

This epic works in conjunction with Epic 4 (Kanban Framework) to provide a complete FR → Task → Story → Epic flow, ensuring that Feature Requests are properly converted to Kanban tasks and tracked through implementation.

---

## Goals

1. **Streamline FR Intake:** Establish clear processes for converting Feature Requests into Kanban tasks
2. **Enable Effective Prioritization:** Provide frameworks and tools for prioritizing FR implementation work
3. **Standardize Implementation Patterns:** Define consistent patterns and best practices for FR implementation
4. **Improve Tracking and Reporting:** Enable comprehensive tracking and reporting of FR implementation progress
5. **Automate FR Workflows:** Develop automation and tooling to streamline FR processing and implementation

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- None

**Blocked By:**
- None

**Coordinates With:**
- **Epic 4 (Kanban Framework):** Uses Kanban intake processes to convert FRs to tasks
- **Epic 2 (Workflow Management):** May use workflows for FR processing automation
- **Epic 3 (Versioning):** Tracks FR implementation with version markers

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** FR intake process may become bottleneck if not properly automated  
  **Mitigation:** Develop automation early (Story 5) and integrate with existing workflows

- **Risk:** Lack of prioritization framework may lead to ad-hoc FR implementation  
  **Mitigation:** Establish prioritization framework early (Story 2) and integrate with planning

- **Risk:** Inconsistent implementation patterns may reduce code quality  
  **Mitigation:** Document patterns and best practices (Story 3) and provide examples
