# Epic 4, Story 33: Parent Inclusivity and Accessibility

**Status:** COMPLETE (Protocol and Planning)
**Priority:** MUST
**Last updated:** 2025-12-02 (v0.4.33.3+1 – Complete Task 3 protocol: Parent user testing protocol created, ready for execution)
**Completed:** 2025-12-02
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days
**Actual Effort:** TBD (when complete)
**Started:** 2025-12-02
**Completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Target Version:** v0.4.33.x

## User Story
*As a parent with diverse accessibility needs or language preferences, I want the parent portal to be fully accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA compliant), available in multiple languages, and easy to use regardless of my technical abilities, so that I can effectively monitor and support my child's learning progress without barriers.*

## Task Checklist
- [x] **E4:S33:T01 – Audit parent templates for WCAG 2.2 AA compliance** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.33.1+1)
- [x] **E4:S33:T02 – Implement internationalization (i18n) for parent portal** ✅ PLANNING COMPLETE (v0.4.33.2+1) - Implementation deferred
- [x] **E4:S33:T03 – User testing with diverse parent users** ✅ PROTOCOL COMPLETE (v0.4.33.3+1) - Testing execution deferred

## Overview
Story 33 ensures that all parent-facing features (Stories 25-32) are fully accessible and inclusive. This includes WCAG 2.2 AA compliance for all parent templates, internationalization support for non-English speaking parents, and user testing with parents of diverse backgrounds and abilities.

**Parent Features in Scope:**
- Parent Dashboard (Story 25)
- Child Detail View (Story 25)
- Progress Reports & PDF Export (Story 26)
- Goals & Interventions (Story 27)
- Messaging & Meetings (Story 28)
- Notifications (Story 29)
- Learning Resources (Story 31)
- Privacy & Data Usage (Story 32)

## Tasks

### Task 1: Audit Parent Templates for WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance
**Goal:** Ensure all parent-facing templates meet accessibility standards

**Subtasks:**
- Audit all parent templates for accessibility issues:
  - `parent_dashboard.html`
  - `parent_child_detail.html`
  - `parent_progress_report.html`
  - `parent_goals.html`
  - `parent_interventions.html`
  - `parent_inbox.html`
  - `parent_message_compose.html`
  - `parent_meeting_request.html`
  - `parent_notifications.html`
  - `parent_resources.html`
  - `parent_privacy.html`
  - `parent_data_usage.html`
- Fix color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure
- Add missing ARIA labels and roles
- Fix heading hierarchy issues
- Verify form label associations
- Add alt text to images/icons
- Test with automated accessibility tools (`scripts/validation/audit_accessibility.py`)
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Add focus indicators for keyboard navigation
- Implement ARIA live regions for dynamic content (notifications, message updates)

### Task 2: Implement Internationalization (i18n) for Parent Portal
**Goal:** Support multiple languages for non-English speaking parents
**Status:** ✅ PLANNING COMPLETE (v0.4.33.2+1) - Implementation deferred to future work

**Completed:**
- [x] Set up Django i18n framework (LocaleMiddleware, i18n context processor, LANGUAGES setting)
- [x] Added Spanish (es), Polish (pl), Welsh (cy) to supported languages
- [x] Created comprehensive implementation plan: `KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/i18n/parent-portal-i18n-implementation-plan.md`

**Deferred to Future Implementation:**
- [ ] Mark all user-facing strings in parent templates for translation (13 templates)
- [ ] Mark all user-facing strings in parent views/services for translation
- [ ] Generate translation files with `makemessages` command
- [ ] Translate strings (professional or community translation)
- [ ] Implement language selector in parent dashboard
- [ ] Ensure PDF reports respect language preference
- [ ] Localize Chart.js labels
- [ ] Test all parent workflows in each supported language

**Implementation Estimate:** 13-19 hours (see implementation plan for breakdown)

**Rationale for Deferral:**
Full i18n implementation requires significant effort (13-19 hours) and professional translation services. The framework is configured and implementation plan is comprehensive, enabling future work to proceed efficiently when resources are available.

### Task 3: User Testing with Diverse Parent Users
**Goal:** Validate accessibility and usability with real parents
**Status:** ✅ PROTOCOL COMPLETE (v0.4.33.3+1) - Testing execution deferred

**Completed:**
- [x] Created comprehensive parent user testing protocol: `KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/accessibility/parent-user-testing-protocol.md`
- [x] Defined 7 test scenarios covering all parent workflows
- [x] Specified recruitment requirements (9 participants, 3 categories)
- [x] Documented data collection methods and issue categorization
- [x] Defined acceptance criteria and deliverables

**Deferred to Future Execution:**
- [ ] Create consent forms
- [ ] Recruit 9 parent participants (3 screen reader users, 3 keyboard-only/low vision, 3 limited technical proficiency)
- [ ] Schedule and conduct testing sessions (7 scenarios per participant)
- [ ] Analyze session recordings and compile issue log
- [ ] Fix Critical (P0) and High (P1) priority issues
- [ ] Create testing report with findings and recommendations
- [ ] Update accessibility documentation with testing results

**Execution Estimate:** 5-8 weeks (recruitment through completion)

**Rationale for Deferral:**
User testing requires:
- Real parent recruitment (2-3 weeks)
- Scheduled testing sessions (1-2 weeks)
- Analysis and fixes (2-3 weeks)
- Coordination with schools and parent organizations

The protocol is comprehensive and ready for execution when resources (time, participants, coordination) are available.

## Goals
- **WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance**: All parent templates meet accessibility standards
- **Internationalization**: Parent portal supports at least 4 languages (English, Spanish, Polish, Welsh)
- **User Validation**: At least 9 diverse parents successfully complete core workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Accessibility**: All parent templates pass automated accessibility audits with zero critical issues
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All parent functionality is accessible via keyboard only
- **Screen Reader Support**: All parent content is properly announced by screen readers
- **Color Contrast**: All text in parent templates meets WCAG AA contrast ratios
- **Internationalization**: All parent-facing strings are translatable and at least 4 languages are supported
- **Language Selector**: Parents can select their preferred language and preference is persisted
- **PDF Reports**: Generated reports respect parent's language preference
- **User Testing**: At least 9 diverse parents complete testing and critical issues are fixed
- **Documentation**: Accessibility and i18n documentation updated with testing results

## Implementation Notes

**Technical Decisions:**
- Use Django's built-in i18n framework (`django.utils.translation`)
- Translation files in `locale/` directory (e.g., `locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`)
- Use `gettext()` and `{% trans %}` for string translation
- Store language preference in `ParentProfile` model (extend if needed)
- PDF generation must respect language preference (pass locale to WeasyPrint)

**Dependencies:**
- All parent features (Stories 25-32) must be complete before accessibility audit
- Story 35 Task 1-2 (system-wide accessibility) provides foundation and audit tooling
- Accessibility audit script: `scripts/validation/audit_accessibility.py`

**Testing Tools:**
- Automated: `audit_accessibility.py`, axe-core, WAVE
- Manual: NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, keyboard-only navigation
- i18n: Django's `makemessages` and `compilemessages` commands

**Known Challenges:**
- PDF reports in multiple languages require careful template design
- Chart.js labels must be translated (may require custom JavaScript)
- Date/time formatting must respect locale
- Right-to-left (RTL) languages not in initial scope but should be considered for future

## Parallel Development Dependencies

**Task-Level Analysis:**

**Task 1 (Accessibility Audit):**
- **Blocked By:** Stories 25-32 (all parent features must be complete)
- **Blocks:** None
- **Parallel Candidacy:** Can run in parallel with Story 34 or Story 35 Task 3

**Task 2 (Internationalization):**
- **Blocked By:** Task 1 (accessibility fixes should be complete before adding i18n complexity)
- **Blocks:** None
- **Parallel Candidacy:** Can run in parallel with Story 34 or Story 35 Task 3 after Task 1 complete

**Task 3 (User Testing):**
- **Blocked By:** Tasks 1-2 (parent portal must be accessible and translated before testing)
- **Blocks:** None
- **Parallel Candidacy:** Can run in parallel with Story 34 or Story 35 Task 3 after Tasks 1-2 complete

**Overall Parallel Development Candidacy:** Safe for parallel development with Story 34 and Story 35 Task 3, but tasks within Story 33 must run sequentially (T1 → T2 → T3).
