# GitHub Submission Guide for FR, BR, UXR, and UAT Reports

**Purpose:** This guide explains how to submit Feature Requests (FR), Bug Reports (BR), User Experience Research (UXR) reports, or User Acceptance Testing (UAT) reports via GitHub Issues.

**Audience:** External contributors, users, automated systems, UX researchers, and projects conducting UAT

---

## Overview

You can submit Bug Reports, Feature Requests, UX Research findings, or User Acceptance Testing (UAT) reports directly through GitHub Issues. These submissions are automatically converted to Kanban documents and processed through our intake workflow.

**⚠️ Note on UAT Reports:** UAT reports require **empirical evidence** (test results, screenshots, logs). We do not accept opinion-based feedback without test evidence.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No repository access required
- ✅ Familiar GitHub interface
- ✅ Automatic conversion to Kanban documents
- ✅ Automatic task creation and tracking
- ✅ Bidirectional linking between GitHub and Kanban

## Automated Processing

### Conversion Process

When you submit an issue using one of our templates:

1. **GitHub Action Triggers:** The `fr-br-intake.yml` workflow runs automatically
2. **Issue Type Detection:** The workflow detects the issue type based on labels:
   - `bug` → Bug Report (BR)
   - `enhancement` → Feature Request (FR)
   - `ux-research` → User Experience Research (UXR)
   - `feedback` or `uat` → User Acceptance Testing Report (FB)
3. **Document Creation:** A new document is created in `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/fr-br/`
4. **Template Population:** The document is populated with issue data
5. **GitHub Link:** The document includes a link back to the GitHub Issue
6. **Issue Comment:** A comment is added to the issue with the document link

### Intake Workflow

After conversion, the document goes through our standard intake workflow:

1. **Review:** The document is reviewed by maintainers
2. **Intake Decision:** Decision is made (ACCEPTED/REJECTED/DEFERRED)
3. **Epic/Story Assignment:** Document is assigned to an Epic and Story
4. **Task Creation:** A Kanban task is created
5. **Status Sync:** Status updates are synced between GitHub and Kanban

## Best Practices

### For Bug Reports

- **Be Specific:** Provide clear steps to reproduce
- **Include Environment:** Specify version, OS, browser, etc.
- **Add Screenshots:** Visual evidence helps understand the issue
- **Check Existing Issues:** Search for similar bugs before submitting

### For Feature Requests

- **Describe the Problem:** Explain what problem this solves
- **Provide Use Cases:** Describe who would benefit and how
- **Be Realistic:** Consider implementation complexity
- **Check Roadmap:** See if similar features are planned

### For UX Research

- **Clear Objectives:** State what you were trying to learn
- **Supporting Evidence:** Include links to recordings, transcripts, or data
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- **Context:** Include relevant context about participants and methodology

---

## Status Updates

Status updates are synced between GitHub Issues and Kanban documents:

- **GitHub → Kanban:** Issue labels and status updates are reflected in Kanban
- **Kanban → GitHub:** Task completion and status updates are reflected in GitHub Issues

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue Not Converted

If your issue isn't automatically converted:

1. **Check Labels:** Ensure the issue has the correct label (`bug`, `enhancement`, or `ux-research`)
2. **Check Template:** Make sure you used the correct template
3. **Check Workflow:** Verify the GitHub Action ran (check Actions tab)
4. **Manual Creation:** If needed, maintainers can manually create the document

### Document Not Found

If you can't find your document:

1. **Check Path:** Documents are in `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/fr-br/`
2. **Check Naming:** Documents follow the pattern `{TYPE}-{NUMBER}-{slug}.md`
3. **Check Issue Comment:** The issue comment includes the document path
