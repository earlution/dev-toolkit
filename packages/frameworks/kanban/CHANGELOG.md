    - Recommends `canonical_adoption` mode when strong semantic matches found
  - **Enhanced `migrate_structure.py`:**
    - New `canonical_adoption` mode for intelligent canonical structure adoption
    - Intelligent task mapping to canonical epics/stories based on semantic matches
    - Automatic reference updating after migration
