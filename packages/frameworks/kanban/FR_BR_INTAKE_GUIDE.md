# FR/BR Intake Process Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-02  
**Framework:** Kanban Framework  
**Related:** `T002-decision-flow-design.md`, `FR_TEMPLATE.md`, `BR_TEMPLATE.md`

---

## Overview

This guide provides a step-by-step process for converting Feature Requests (FRs) and Bug Reports (BRs) into Kanban Tasks, Stories, and Epics. It operationalizes the decision flow design and demonstrates how to use the FR/BR templates.

**Key Principles:**
- All work is **Task/FR-driven**
- FRs/BRs must generate a Kanban Task on the appropriate Story
- If no Story exists, create one under the appropriate Epic
- If no Epic exists, create a broad abstract Epic for the new Story
- Version numbers follow `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` schema

---

## Step-by-Step Intake Process

### Step 1: Receive and Capture FR/BR

**Action:** Create a new FR or BR document using the appropriate template.

**For Feature Requests:**
- Use `FR_TEMPLATE.md`
- Location: `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/fr-br/FR-XXX-[title].md` (or project-specific location)

**For Bug Reports:**
- Use `BR_TEMPLATE.md`
- Location: `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/fr-br/BR-XXX-[title].md` (or project-specific location)

**Required Information:**
- Summary (one sentence)
- Description (detailed)
- Priority/Severity
- Scope Analysis (for FR) or Affected Component (for BR)
- Acceptance Criteria

---

### Step 2: Classify and Extract Key Information

**For Feature Requests:**
- Extract: Desired functionality, use case, scope, problem domain
- Identify: Affected areas (Backend, Frontend, Database, etc.)
- Estimate: Complexity (Simple, Medium, Complex, Very Complex)

**For Bug Reports:**
- Extract: Affected component, symptoms, severity, steps to reproduce
- Identify: Root cause (if known)
- Assess: User impact and business impact

---

### Step 3: Search for Existing Story

**Search Criteria:**
1. **Scope Alignment:** Story's goal/scope encompasses FR/BR requirements
2. **Problem Domain:** Story addresses the same problem domain or feature area
3. **Status Check:** Story is not COMPLETE or DEFERRED
4. **Epic Alignment:** Story's Epic aligns with FR/BR's problem domain

**Search Locations:**
- Kanban Board (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/kanban-board.md`)
- Epic documents (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-X.md`)
- Story documents (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-X/stories/Story-XXX-*.md`)

**Decision:** If Story matches **ALL** criteria → Proceed to Step 4a. Otherwise → Proceed to Step 4b.

---

### Step 4a: Story Match Found - Create Task

**Action:** Create a new Task under the existing Story.

**Process:**
1. Open the Story document
2. Add new Task to the Task Checklist
3. Add Task details in the Tasks section
4. Assign version number: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
   - RC: Current release candidate (usually 0 for development)
   - EPIC: Epic number from Story
   - STORY: Story number
   - TASK: Next available Task number
   - BUILD: 1 (incremented by RW)

**Example:** If Story is Epic 3, Story 2, and it has Tasks 1-3, create Task 4 → Version: `0.3.2.4+1`

**Update FR/BR Document:**
- Set Intake Status: ACCEPTED
- Mark "Story Match Found" in Decision Flow Results
- Record Epic, Story, Task, and Version
- Add Kanban links

**Update Kanban Board:**
- Ensure Story status reflects new Task
- Update Story's Task count if needed

---

### Step 4b: No Story Match - Search for Epic

**Search Criteria:**
1. **Domain Alignment:** Epic's problem domain matches FR/BR's problem domain
2. **Status Check:** Epic is not COMPLETE or DEFERRED
3. **Scope Check:** Epic's scope is broad enough to encompass FR/BR

**Search Locations:**
- Kanban Board (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/kanban-board.md`)
- Epic documents (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-X.md`)

**Decision:** If Epic matches **ALL** criteria → Proceed to Step 5a. Otherwise → Proceed to Step 5b.

---

### Step 5a: Epic Match Found - Create Story and Task

**Action:** Create a new Story under the existing Epic, then create Task 1 under the new Story.

**Process:**
1. **Create Story:**
   - Use `STORY_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Location: `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-X/stories/Story-XXX-[title].md`
   - Set Story number to next available number in Epic
   - Set Status: TODO or IN PROGRESS
   - Define Story goal/scope based on FR/BR

2. **Create Task:**
   - Add Task 1 to Story's Task Checklist
   - Add Task details in Story's Tasks section
   - Assign version number: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
     - EPIC: Epic number
     - STORY: New Story number
     - TASK: 1
     - BUILD: 1

**Example:** If Epic 2 has Stories 1-2, create Story 3 → Task 1 → Version: `0.2.3.1+1`

3. **Update Epic Document:**
   - Add Story to Epic's Story Checklist
   - Add Story details in Epic's Stories section
   - Update Epic status if needed

4. **Update FR/BR Document:**
   - Set Intake Status: ACCEPTED
   - Mark "New Story Created" in Decision Flow Results
   - Record Epic, Story, Task, and Version
   - Add Kanban links

5. **Update Kanban Board:**
   - Add new Story to board
   - Update Epic's Story count

---

### Step 5b: No Epic Match - Create Epic, Story, and Task

**Action:** Create a new Epic, then Story 1, then Task 1.

**Process:**
1. **Create Epic:**
   - Use `EPIC_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Location: `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-X.md`
   - Set Epic number to next available number
   - **CRITICAL:** Epic must be **broad and abstract** in concept
   - Define Epic's problem domain and scope
   - Set Status: TODO or IN PROGRESS

2. **Create Story:**
   - Use `STORY_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Location: `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-X/stories/Story-001-[title].md`
   - Set Story number to 1
   - Set Status: TODO or IN PROGRESS
   - Define Story goal/scope based on FR/BR

3. **Create Task:**
   - Add Task 1 to Story's Task Checklist
   - Add Task details in Story's Tasks section
   - Assign version number: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
     - EPIC: New Epic number
     - STORY: 1
     - TASK: 1
     - BUILD: 1

**Example:** If current Epics are 1-7, create Epic 8 → Story 1 → Task 1 → Version: `0.8.1.1+1`

4. **Update Kanban Board:**
   - Add new Epic to board
   - Add new Story to board

5. **Update FR/BR Document:**
   - Set Intake Status: ACCEPTED
   - Mark "New Epic Created" in Decision Flow Results
   - Record Epic, Story, Task, and Version
   - Add Kanban links

---

### Step 6: Assign Version Number

**Version Schema:** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`

**Rules:**
- RC: Release Candidate (0 = development, 1+ = release candidate)
- EPIC: Epic number (matches assigned Epic)
- STORY: Story number (matches assigned Story)
- TASK: Task number (matches assigned Task)
- BUILD: Build number (starts at 1, incremented by Release Workflow)

**Update Version File:**
- **CRITICAL:** Update `src/[project]/version.py` (or project-specific version file)
- Set `VERSION_EPIC` to match assigned Epic number
- Set `VERSION_STORY` to match assigned Story number
- **CRITICAL:** Set `VERSION_TASK` to match assigned Task number
- **CRITICAL:** Set `VERSION_BUILD = 1` (new Tasks always start at BUILD 1)
- **Validation:** Verify `VERSION_TASK` matches the Task number you just created

**Example Update:**
```python
# Creating Task 2 in Epic 4, Story 3
VERSION_EPIC = 4
VERSION_STORY = 3
VERSION_TASK = 2  # ← Must match new Task number
VERSION_BUILD = 1  # ← Always 1 for new Tasks
```

**Note:** Version numbers are assigned at Task creation. The Release Workflow (RW) will:
- Validate that `VERSION_TASK` matches the active Task number (Step 1)
- Automatically detect Task transitions and update `VERSION_TASK` if needed (Step 2)
- Increment `VERSION_BUILD` when work is completed and released (Step 2, same Task only)

---

### Step 7: Update Kanban Board

**Actions:**
1. Update `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/kanban-board.md`:
   - Add new Epic (if created)
   - Add new Story (if created)
   - Update Story status (if Task added)
   - Update Epic status (if Story added)

2. Update `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/_index.md`:
   - Update Epic/Story counts
   - Update status summaries

**Consistency Check:**
- Ensure board matches Epic/Story documents
- Ensure status fields are synchronized

---

### Step 8: Link FR/BR to Task

**Actions:**
1. **In FR/BR Document:**
   - Complete "Intake Decision" section
   - Add Kanban links (Epic, Story, Task)
   - Set Intake Status: ACCEPTED

2. **In Story Document:**
   - Add reference to FR/BR in Task's "References" section
   - Link to FR/BR document

3. **In Epic Document (if needed):**
   - Add reference to FR/BR in Story's "References" section

**Traceability:**
- FR/BR → Task link: FR/BR document's "Intake Decision" section
- Task → FR/BR link: Story document's Task "References" section

---

    - Epic 2, Story 1, Task 5 → `0.2.1.5+1`
    - Epic 3, Story 2, Task 3 → `0.3.2.3+1`
    - Epic 1, Story 3, Task 2 → `0.1.3.2+1`
  - Kanban Links: All three Tasks

**Result:** FR converted to three Tasks across three different Epics/Stories.

**Note:** Complex FRs may require coordination between multiple Tasks. Ensure dependencies are documented in each Task's "Dependencies" section.

---

## Integration Points

### Kanban Integration

- **Templates:** Use EPIC_TEMPLATE, STORY_TEMPLATE for new items
- **Board Updates:** Always update `kanban-board.md` and `_index.md`
- **Status Synchronization:** Ensure Epic, Story, and Task status fields match
- **Forensic Markers:** RW will add version markers when Tasks are completed

### Versioning Integration

- **Version Schema:** `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
- **Version Assignment:** Assigned at Task creation
- **Version File:** Update `src/[project]/version.py` (or project-specific)
- **Canonical Ordering:** Version numbers provide canonical ordering (not timestamps)

### Release Workflow Integration

- **Task Completion:** When Task is completed, RW increments BUILD
- **Changelog Updates:** RW creates detailed and summary changelog entries
- **Kanban Updates:** RW Step 6 updates Epic/Story documents with version markers
- **Fix Verification:** BR fixes must be verified before being marked as "Fixed"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find matching Story or Epic

**Solution:**
1. Review existing Epics/Stories more broadly
2. Consider if FR/BR scope is too narrow or too broad
3. Check if Epic/Story status allows new work (not COMPLETE/DEFERRED)
4. If truly no match, create new Epic/Story as needed

### Issue: FR/BR spans multiple problem domains

**Solution:**
1. Break FR/BR into multiple Tasks (see Example 6)
2. Create Tasks under appropriate Stories/Epics
3. Document dependencies between Tasks
4. Coordinate work across Tasks

### Issue: Unsure about Epic scope

**Solution:**
1. Review Epic creation guidelines: Epics must be **broad and abstract**
2. If Epic is too specific, it may need to be a Story under a broader Epic
3. Consult Kanban governance policy for Epic creation criteria

### Issue: Version number conflicts

**Solution:**
1. Ensure version follows `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` schema
2. Check that EPIC, STORY, TASK numbers match assigned Epic/Story/Task
3. BUILD starts at 1 for new Tasks
4. RW increments BUILD when Task is completed
