# Canonical Epics for Kanban Framework

**Purpose:** This document lists the canonical set of epics that are part of the Kanban framework package. These epics represent the standard organizational structure for projects using the Kanban framework.

**Usage:** When adopting the Kanban framework, these canonical epics provide the foundation for organizing work. Projects can add additional epics as needed, but these represent the core framework structure.

> **📚 Complete Reference:** For the complete canonical structure including all epics (1-23+), stories, and tasks with detailed descriptions, see [`COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md`](COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md). This document provides an overview of all canonical epics.

---

## Core Framework Epics (1-8)

These epics are part of the ai-dev-kit framework and should be included in all projects. They represent universal needs that almost any category of prospective user will require.

**Core Epics (Always Installed):**
- Epic 1: Project Core
- Epic 2: Workflow Management Framework
- Epic 3: Numbering & Versioning Framework
- Epic 4: Kanban Framework
- Epic 5: FR Implementation
- Epic 6: BR Implementation
- Epic 7: UXR (User Experience Research)
- Epic 8: Codebase Maintenance and Review

**Note:** Epics 1-6 are framework infrastructure epics. Epic 7: UXR (User Experience Research) bridges framework and project work. Epic 8: Codebase Maintenance and Review is a universal project need.

---

## Ancillary Epics (9-21)

These epics represent common patterns found in ambitious projects. Use as needed based on project scope, following the chronological adoption order: 9 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 19 → 20 → 21.

**Ancillary Epics (Users Pick and Choose):**

3. **Epic 3: Versioning** - Operational framework for versioning
4. **Epic 4: Kanban** - Operational framework for Kanban
5. **Epic 5: FR Implementation** - Implementation epic that supports Kanban (FRs come first)
6. **Epic 6: BR Implementation** - Implementation epic that supports Kanban (BRs follow FRs)
7. **Epic 7: UXR** - User research epic that bridges framework and project work
8. **Epic 8: Codebase Maintenance** - Universal maintenance need

**Core+ Epics (10, 18, 22, 23):**
- **Epic 10:** Data Management - Universal data need (Epic 9 reserved for User Management)
- **Epic 18:** Documentation - Universal documentation need
- **Epic 22:** Architecture Refactoring - Universal code quality need
- **Epic 23:** Process Automation & CI/CD - Universal development process need

**Ancillary Epics (9, 11-17, 19-21):**
- **Epic 9:** User Management and Authentication (if multi-user app)
- **Epics 11-17:** API, Frontend, Testing, Deployment, Security, Performance, Integration
- **Epics 19-21:** Analytics, Mobile, Internationalization

**Ordering Principles:**
- Foundational epics come first (Epic 1)
- Operational frameworks follow (Epics 2-4)
- Implementation epics that support frameworks come next (Epics 5-6)
- User research epic (Epic 7) bridges framework and project work
- Maintenance epic (Epic 8) represents ongoing operational work
- Core+ epics (10, 18, 22, 23) are universal needs recommended by default
- Ancillary epics (9, 11-17, 19-21) are added based on project needs
- FR Implementation (Epic 5) comes before BR Implementation (Epic 6) because Feature Requests typically precede Bug Reports in the intake flow
- Chronological adoption order: Core (1-8) → Core+ (10, 18, 22, 23) → Ancillary (9, 11-17, 19-21)

## Adding New Canonical Epics

When an epic pattern proves reusable across multiple projects, it should be added to this document and the comprehensive structure:

1. **Identify Pattern:** Epic appears in multiple projects or represents a common organizational need
   - Pattern must appear in at least 3 different projects
   - Pattern must represent a fundamental organizational structure
   - Pattern must be reusable across different domains

2. **Document Pattern:** Create entry in this document and `COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md` with:
   - Epic number (following canonical order, after Epic 23)
   - Purpose (clear, concise statement)
   - Scope (what's included/excluded)
   - Key characteristics (distinguishing features)
   - Typical stories (common story patterns)
   - Integration points (how it relates to other canonical epics)
   - Ordering rationale (why it comes in this position)

3. **Update Framework:** Add to Kanban framework documentation
   - Update `CANONICAL_EPICS.md` (this document)
   - Update `COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md`
   - Update `README.md` with new epic count
   - Update intake guides to reference new epic
   - Update examples to show new epic usage

4. **Update References:** Update all references to canonical epics in intake guides and other documentation
   - `FR_BR_INTAKE_GUIDE.md`
   - `FR_BR_INTAKE_AGENT_GUIDE.md`
   - `FR_BR_INTAKE_USER_GUIDE.md`
   - `FR_BR_INTAKE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
   - Any other framework documentation
