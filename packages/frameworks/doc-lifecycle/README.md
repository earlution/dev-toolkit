# Document Lifecycle Management

**Portable Package:** This directory contains the Document Lifecycle Management framework for managing Knowledge Base (KB) document lifecycle with TTL-based expiration and automated housekeeping.

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-04  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## 🧩 Modularity & Dependencies

This package is designed to be **fully modular** with maximum independence. It can be used standalone or combined with other packages.

### Standalone Usage

✅ **This package can be used completely independently** without requiring any other `vibe-dev-kit` packages.

**What you get standalone:**
- Complete document lifecycle metadata specification
- Document lifecycle policy and governance rules
- Lifecycle classification rules (evergreen/timeboxed/transient)
- TTL-based expiration system
- Housekeeping process documentation
- Agent requirements and rules

**Hard dependencies (required):**
- None — this is a pure documentation/policy package

**Independence score:** 10/10 — Pure documentation/policy, no runtime dependencies.

---

### Combined Usage

**With Kanban Package:**
- Lifecycle metadata can be applied to Kanban Epics/Stories
- Integration: Kanban docs can have lifecycle metadata for housekeeping
- Optional: Kanban can work without lifecycle management

**With Workflow Management Package:**
- Doc Housekeeping Workflow can automate lifecycle management
- Integration: RW can set lifecycle metadata when creating docs
- Optional: Workflow mgt can work without lifecycle management

**With Both Packages:**
- Complete integration: RW sets lifecycle → Housekeeping Workflow manages expiration
- Automated lifecycle management for all KB documents

## 📋 Package Overview

The Document Lifecycle Management framework provides a **TTL-based expiration system** for managing Knowledge Base documents, preventing documentation bloat while preserving valuable content.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Lifecycle classification (evergreen, timeboxed, transient)
- ✅ TTL-based expiration (time-to-live in days)
- ✅ Reference-aware cleanup (protects referenced docs)
- ✅ Automated housekeeping (archive or delete expired docs)
- ✅ Agent-driven management (explicit lifecycle rules)
- ✅ Audit trail preservation (archive instead of delete for evidence)

**Lifecycle Types:**
- **Evergreen** — Permanent, canonical documentation (standards, ADRs, Kanban Epics/Stories)
- **Timeboxed** — Temporarily useful, archive after period (design spikes, analysis docs)
- **Transient** — Operational scratch, delete after period (renumbering plans, implementation sequences)

---

## 🎯 When to Use Document Lifecycle Management

**Use Document Lifecycle Management when:**
- ✅ KB has many temporary planning/implementation documents
- ✅ Documentation bloat is becoming a problem
- ✅ You want automated cleanup of obsolete docs
- ✅ You need to preserve evergreen content while cleaning up temporary docs
- ✅ You want agent-driven lifecycle management

**Don't use when:**
- ❌ KB is small and manually manageable
- ❌ All documents are permanent (no temporary docs)
- ❌ You prefer manual cleanup over automation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Copy Package

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Copy, Don't Reference**

Copy this entire package into your project:

```bash
cp -r packages/frameworks/doc-lifecycle/ <your-project>/packages/frameworks/doc-lifecycle/
```

### 2. Review Policies

Read the core policies:
- `policies/doc-lifecycle-metadata-spec.md` — Metadata schema
- `policies/doc-lifecycle-policy.md` — Governance and enforcement

### 3. Apply Lifecycle Metadata

Add lifecycle metadata to your KB documents:

```yaml
---
lifecycle: evergreen | timeboxed | transient
ttl_days: <integer> | null
created_at: <ISO 8601 datetime>
expires_at: <ISO 8601 datetime> | null
housekeeping_policy: keep | archive | delete
---
# Your Document Title

Document content...
```

### 4. Use Templates

Use the templates in `templates/` when creating new documents:
- `DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md` — Template with lifecycle metadata
- `LIFECYCLE_EXAMPLES.md` — Examples for each lifecycle type

### 5. (Future) Run Housekeeping Workflow

When the Doc Housekeeping Workflow is implemented, run it periodically to clean up expired documents.

## 📊 Lifecycle Classification Examples

| Document Type | Lifecycle | TTL (days) | Housekeeping Policy |
|---------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Standards & ADRs | `evergreen` | `null` | `keep` |
| Kanban Epics/Stories | `evergreen` | `null` | `keep` |
| Design Spikes | `timeboxed` | `90` | `archive` |
| Refactoring Plans | `timeboxed` | `90` | `archive` |
| Renumbering Plans | `transient` | `14` | `delete` |
| Implementation Sequences | `transient` | `30` | `delete` |

See [`templates/LIFECYCLE_EXAMPLES.md`](./templates/LIFECYCLE_EXAMPLES.md) for detailed examples.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Lifecycle Classification

Documents are classified by their intended persistence:
- **Evergreen** — Permanent, canonical documentation
- **Timeboxed** — Temporarily useful, archive after period
- **Transient** — Operational scratch, delete after period

### TTL-Based Expiration

Time-to-live (TTL) determines when documents become eligible for housekeeping:
- `ttl_days: null` — No expiration (evergreen)
- `ttl_days: 90` — Expires after 90 days (timeboxed)
- `ttl_days: 14` — Expires after 14 days (transient)

### Reference-Aware Cleanup

Documents referenced from evergreen sources are protected from deletion:
- Links from `lifecycle: evergreen` documents
- References in released changelogs
- Git commit history (always preserved)

### Agent-Driven Management

AI agents create and maintain lifecycle metadata automatically:
- Set lifecycle based on document type
- Apply default TTL and housekeeping policy
- Calculate `expires_at` from `created_at + ttl_days`
- Log lifecycle promotions/demotions

---

## 🛡️ Protection Rules

Documents **MUST NOT** be deleted if they are:
1. Referenced from evergreen docs
2. Referenced in changelogs
3. Referenced in git history (always preserved via git)

**Action:** Auto-upgrade to `archive` instead of `delete` if references found.

```

### Timeboxed Analysis

created_at: 2025-12-04T11:30:00Z
expires_at: 2025-03-04T11:30:00Z
housekeeping_policy: archive

### Transient Renumbering Plan

```yaml
---
lifecycle: transient
ttl_days: 14
created_at: 2025-12-04T11:30:00Z
expires_at: 2025-12-18T11:30:00Z
housekeeping_policy: delete

## 🚧 Future Work

- **Doc Housekeeping Workflow** — Automated housekeeping workflow (YAML + agent execution guide)
- **Validation Scripts** — Validator for lifecycle metadata and scanner for expired documents
- **Integration with RW** — RW automatically sets lifecycle metadata when creating docs
