## Analysis Summary

**Total Epics Analyzed:** 50+ epics across 6 projects  
**Canonical Epics Found:** 21 (already in canonical set)  
**New Patterns Identified:** 6 potential additions  
**High Priority Additions:** 2 (Epic 22, Epic 23)  
**Medium Priority Additions:** 1 (Epic 24, conditional)

**Key Findings:**
- Current canonical set (Epics 1-21) covers most common patterns
- Architecture Refactoring and CI/CD are missing but common
- Permission systems are common but may be too specific
- Most project-specific epics are domain-specific (games, apps)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review Recommendations:** Evaluate Epic 22, 23, 24 for inclusion
2. **Create Epic Templates:** If approved, create canonical templates
3. **Update Comprehensive Structure:** Add approved epics to canonical structure
4. **Document Patterns:** Document organizational patterns separately
