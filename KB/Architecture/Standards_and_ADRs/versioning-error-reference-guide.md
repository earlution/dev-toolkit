- The same error occurs again (BUILD incremented instead of TASK)
- Reviewing versioning procedures
- Onboarding new team members
- Debugging versioning issues
- Strengthening RW Step 2 (Bump Version) procedures

**This document references:**
- Root cause analysis
- Step-by-step procedure
- Policy documents
- Fix implementation

## Quick Reference: The Error

### What Happened (Anti-Pattern)

**Error:** BUILD was incremented instead of TASK when completing new tasks.

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong:** T003 completed → `0.11.1.1+2` (BUILD incremented, TASK unchanged)
- ✅ **Correct:** T003 completed → `0.11.1.3+1` (TASK incremented to 3, BUILD reset to 1)

**Impact:** Multiple tasks can be released with TASK=1, only BUILD incremented (1-9), breaking version traceability.

### The Fix

**Solution:** Explicit, mandatory step-by-step procedure in RW Step 2 that:

1. **MUST** read Story file to identify completed task
2. **MUST** extract task number from task identifier
3. **MUST** compare task number to current VERSION_TASK
4. **MUST** validate before and after updating

**See:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` Step 2 for complete procedure.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause

**Location:** RW Step 2 (Bump Version) instructions

**Original Problem (from other project):**
```
1. **Bump Version** - Read version file, determine next version (increment BUILD for same task, or set new TASK+BUILD=1), update file.
```

**Problems:**
1. **No method to determine which case:** "increment BUILD for same task, or set new TASK+BUILD=1" - but HOW do I know which one?
2. **No source of truth:** Doesn't tell WHERE to find which task was completed
3. **No validation:** Doesn't require checking that TASK matches completed work
4. **Assumes knowledge:** Implies agent already knows if it's the same task or new task

### Secondary Root Causes

1. **No mandatory Story file check:**
   - Instruction doesn't require reading Story file
   - Story file is the source of truth for completed tasks
   - Task numbers are clearly visible in Story file: `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}`

2. **No task number extraction step:**
   - No instruction to extract task number from completed task identifier
   - No instruction to compare task number to current VERSION_TASK

3. **No validation step:**
   - No requirement to validate TASK number matches completed task
   - No requirement to verify before/after updating

4. **Default behavior:**
   - Agent defaulted to "increment BUILD" without checking
   - No explicit check forced agent to verify task context

### Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work

**Previous attempts:**
- Added versioning policy references
- Added examples
- Added warnings

**What was missing:**
- **Explicit, step-by-step procedure** that cannot be skipped
- **Mandatory checks** that force reading Story file
- **Validation steps** that catch errors before updating
- **Clear decision logic** with examples

## The Fix: What Was Changed

### 1. Updated RW Step 2 in cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md

**Changed from:**
```
2. **Bump Version** - Read version file, determine next version using schema calculation:
   - **Same Task:** Increment BUILD (e.g., `0.E.S.T+B` → `0.E.S.T+{B+1}`)
   - **New Task:** Set new TASK and BUILD=1 (e.g., `0.E.S.T+B` → `0.E.S.{T+1}+1`)
```

**Changed to:**
```
2. **Bump Version** - **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS (DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP):**

   **A. READ CURRENT VERSION:**
   - Read `src/{project}/version.py` to get current `VERSION_EPIC`, `VERSION_STORY`, `VERSION_TASK`, `VERSION_BUILD`
   - Document current version: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`

   **B. IDENTIFY COMPLETED TASK (MANDATORY):**
   - Read the Story file: `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-{epic}/stories/Story-{story}-*.md`
   - Find the MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED task in the Task Checklist (marked `✅ COMPLETE`)
   - Extract the task number from the task identifier: `E{epic}:S{story}:T{task}` (e.g., `E2:S02:T008` → task number is `8`)
   - **CRITICAL:** If no task is marked complete, or you cannot identify which task was just completed, **STOP** and ask the user which task was completed

   **C. DETERMINE VERSION BUMP (MANDATORY LOGIC):**
   - Compare completed task number to current `VERSION_TASK`:
     - **IF completed task number > current VERSION_TASK:** This is a NEW TASK
       - Set `VERSION_TASK` = completed task number
       - Set `VERSION_BUILD` = 1 (reset to 1 for new task)
       - Example: Current `0.2.2.3+5`, completed T008 → New version: `0.2.2.8+1`
     - **IF completed task number == current VERSION_TASK:** This is SAME TASK, new build
       - Keep `VERSION_TASK` unchanged
       - Increment `VERSION_BUILD` by 1
       - Example: Current `0.2.2.3+1`, completed T003 → New version: `0.2.2.3+2`
     - **IF completed task number < current VERSION_TASK:** This is an ERROR
       - **STOP** and report error: "Completed task number ({completed}) is less than current VERSION_TASK ({current}). This indicates a versioning error. Please verify which task was actually completed."

   **D. VALIDATE BEFORE UPDATING:**
   - Verify: New `VERSION_TASK` matches completed task number
   - Verify: If new task, `VERSION_BUILD` = 1; if same task, `VERSION_BUILD` = current + 1
   - Document decision: "Task {completed_task} completed. Current TASK={current_task}, BUILD={current_build}. Decision: {new_task/new_build} → TASK={new_task}, BUILD={new_build}"

   **E. UPDATE VERSION FILE:**
   - Update `VERSION_TASK` and `VERSION_BUILD` in `src/{project}/version.py`
   - Update `VERSION_STRING` to reflect new version
   - Update `VERSION_INFO["description"]` if present

   **F. VALIDATE AFTER UPDATING:**
   - Re-read `version.py` and verify the new version matches your decision
   - Confirm: `VERSION_TASK` = completed task number
   - Confirm: `VERSION_BUILD` = 1 (if new task) or current+1 (if same task)

   Use format: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced vague instruction with explicit 6-step procedure (A-F)
- ✅ Added mandatory Story file read (Step B)
- ✅ Added mandatory task number extraction (Step B)
- ✅ Added mandatory comparison logic (Step C)
- ✅ Added validation before updating (Step D)
- ✅ Added validation after updating (Step F)
- ✅ Added error handling for invalid cases

### 2. Updated release-workflow-agent-execution.md Step 2

**Enhanced ANALYZE phase:**
- Made Story file read **MANDATORY** and explicit
- Added task number extraction requirement
- Added comparison requirement

**Enhanced DETERMINE phase:**
- Made task transition detection explicit
- Added clear decision logic with examples
- Added validation requirements

**Enhanced VALIDATE phase:**
- Added mandatory verification that `VERSION_TASK` matches completed task
- Added verification that `VERSION_BUILD` is correct (1 for new task, incremented for same task)

### 3. Updated Key Principles

**Added to cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md:**
- ✅ **Mandatory Task Identification:** Step 2 MUST read Story file to identify completed task number
- ✅ **Version Validation:** Step 2 MUST validate TASK number matches completed task before and after updating
- ❌ **Never Skip Task Identification:** Always read Story file to find completed task number
- ❌ **Never Assume Same Task:** Always compare completed task number to current VERSION_TASK
