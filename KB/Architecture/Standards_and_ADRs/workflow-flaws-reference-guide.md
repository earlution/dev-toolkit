## WF-001: Story File Not Updated First (Step 7)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date Discovered:** 2025-12-04  
**Date Fixed:** 2025-12-04  
**Related Work:** Epic 3, Story 3, Task 5

### Quick Reference: The Flaw

**Anti-Pattern:** Story file (authoritative source) wasn't being updated with forensic markers before Epic file was updated to match it.

**Symptom:**
- Story file task checklist lacks forensic markers
- Epic file matches Story file (correct behavior)
- But Epic file also lacks forensic markers (because Story file lacked them)
- Result: Both files in incomplete state

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong:** Epic file updated to match Story file, but Story file never updated with `✅ COMPLETE (v0.11.5.2+1)`
- ✅ **Correct:** Story file updated FIRST with forensic markers, then Epic file updated to match

**Impact:** Forensic markers missing from both Story and Epic documents, breaking traceability.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Root Cause:**
- **Location:** RW Step 7 (Auto-update Kanban Docs) instructions
- **Problem:** Step 6 treated Story file as authoritative source but didn't update it
- **Workflow Gap:** One-way sync where Epic matched Story, but Story wasn't updated during RW

**What Happened:**
1. Step 7 read Story file to get "correct state"
2. Step 7 updated Epic file to match Story file
3. But Step 7 never updated Story file with forensic markers
4. Result: Story file (authoritative) lacked markers, Epic matched that incomplete state

**Why It Happened:**
- Step 7 documentation said "read Story file to get correct state" and "update Epic to match Story"
- But it didn't say "update Story file FIRST, then update Epic to match"
- The order of operations wasn't explicit
- Story file was treated as read-only authoritative source, not as something to update

### The Fix

**Solution:** Explicit order requirement in RW Step 7:

1. **FIRST:** Update Story file (`Story-{N}-{Name}.md`) task checklist with forensic markers
2. **THEN:** Update Epic-{epic}.md to match the updated Story file

**Implementation:**
- Updated `release-workflow-agent-execution.md` Step 6 EXECUTE phase
- Updated `cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` Step 6 instructions
- Made order explicit: Story file FIRST, then Epic file

**See:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` Step 6
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` Step 6

### Prevention

**How to Prevent:**
- Always update Story file FIRST with forensic markers
- Then update Epic file to match the updated Story file
- Follow explicit order: Story → Epic
- Validate both files have forensic markers after update

**Key Principle:**
- Story file is authoritative source, but it must be updated during RW
- Epic file matches Story file, so Story must be updated first

## WF-002: Version Bump Logic Error (Step 2)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date Discovered:** 2025-12-03  
**Date Fixed:** 2025-12-03  
**Related Work:** Epic 2, Story 2 (PDCA Integration)

### Quick Reference: The Flaw

**Anti-Pattern:** BUILD was incremented instead of TASK when completing new tasks.

**Symptom:**
- Version shows wrong TASK component (e.g., `0.1.1.1+2` for Task 2)
- BUILD increments when it should reset (e.g., `0.1.1.1+3` for Task 3)
- Version doesn't match completed task number

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong:** T003 completed → `0.11.1.1+2` (BUILD incremented, TASK unchanged)
- ✅ **Correct:** T003 completed → `0.11.1.3+1` (TASK incremented to 3, BUILD reset to 1)

**Impact:** Multiple tasks can be released with TASK=1, only BUILD incremented (1-9), breaking version traceability.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Root Cause:**
- **Location:** RW Step 2 (Bump Version) instructions
- **Problem:** Vague instruction didn't specify how to determine if task is new or same
- **Missing:** No mandatory Story file read, no task number extraction, no validation

**Why It Happened:**
- Instruction said "increment BUILD for same task, or set new TASK+BUILD=1"
- But didn't specify HOW to determine which case
- No source of truth specified (where to find completed task)
- Agent defaulted to "increment BUILD" without checking

### The Fix

**Solution:** Explicit, mandatory step-by-step procedure in RW Step 2:

1. **MUST** read Story file to identify completed task
2. **MUST** extract task number from task identifier
3. **MUST** compare task number to current VERSION_TASK
4. **MUST** validate before and after updating

**See:**
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` Step 2
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` Step 2
- `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/versioning-error-reference-guide.md` (detailed analysis)

### Prevention

**How to Prevent:**
- Always read Story file first (source of truth)
- Always extract task number from task identifier
- Always compare completed task vs. current VERSION_TASK
- Always validate before and after updating

## Key Takeaways

### Common Patterns in Flaws

1. **Missing Explicit Order:** Steps don't specify order of operations
2. **Missing Mandatory Checks:** Steps don't require reading source of truth
3. **Missing Validation:** Steps don't validate before/after state
4. **Vague Instructions:** Steps use ambiguous language instead of explicit procedures

### How Flaws Are Fixed

1. **Make Order Explicit:** Specify FIRST/THEN order of operations
2. **Add Mandatory Checks:** Require reading source of truth
3. **Add Validation:** Require before/after validation
4. **Clarify Instructions:** Replace vague language with explicit step-by-step procedures

### How to Prevent Future Flaws

1. **Follow Explicit Procedures:** Don't skip steps, follow order
2. **Read Source of Truth First:** Always read authoritative sources
3. **Validate Everything:** Check before and after state
4. **Document Decisions:** Show your work, explain choices

## WF-003: BR/FR Fix Attempts Not Documented

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date Discovered:** 2025-12-05  
**Date Fixed:** 2025-12-05  
**Related Work:** Epic 3, Story 3 (Versioning Integration with Kanban & RW)

### Quick Reference: The Flaw

**Anti-Pattern:** Fix attempts for bugs weren't being documented in Bug Report (BR) or Feature Request (FR) documents, preventing knowledge transfer between builds.

**Symptom:**
- Bug fix attempted in release v0.X.Y.Z+N
- Bug still present in subsequent releases
- No record of what was attempted, what worked, what didn't
- Next build starts from scratch without learning from previous attempts
- Result: Repeated fix attempts, wasted effort, no knowledge accumulation

**Example:**
- ❌ **Wrong:** Bug fixed in v0.2.1.1+3, bug still present, no documentation of fix attempt
- ✅ **Correct:** Bug fix attempted in v0.2.1.1+3, documented in BR "Fix Attempt History" section with what was tried, what worked, what didn't, and lessons learned

**Impact:** Knowledge loss between builds, repeated fix attempts, inability to learn from previous attempts.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Root Cause:**
- **Location:** Release Workflow (RW) lacked a step to update BR/FR documents
- **Problem:** RW updated Kanban docs, changelogs, version files, but not BR/FR docs
- **Workflow Gap:** No mechanism to document fix attempts in BR/FR documents during release

**What Happened:**
1. Bug fix attempted in release
2. Changelog updated with fix description
3. Kanban docs updated with version markers
4. But BR/FR document never updated with fix attempt information
5. Result: No record of fix attempt in BR/FR document

**Why It Happened:**
- RW focused on versioning, changelogs, and Kanban updates
- BR/FR documents were treated as intake artifacts, not living documents
- No step existed to update BR/FR docs during release
- Fix attempt information existed in changelog but not in BR/FR document

### The Fix

**Solution:** Added new RW Step 6: "Update BR/FR Docs" before "Auto-update Kanban Docs" (now Step 7).

**Implementation:**
1. **Updated BR Template:**
   - Added "Fix Attempt History" section to `BR_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Template includes fields for:
     - Fix Description
     - Changes Made
     - Verification Status
     - Result (Fixed/Partially Fixed/Not Fixed)
     - Lessons Learned
     - Next Steps

2. **Created RW Step 6:**
   - **Purpose:** Document flaws, attempted fixes, and verification status in BR/FR docs
   - **For Bug Reports:**
     - Search for BR files linked to completed task
     - Add new entry to "Fix Attempt History" section
     - Document flaw description, attempted fix, verification status, lessons learned
   - **For Feature Requests:**
     - Search for FR files linked to completed task
     - Update "Intake Decision" section with implementation status
     - Document implementation details and verification status

3. **Updated RW Documentation:**
   - Updated `release-workflow-agent-execution.md` with new Step 6
   - Updated `cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` with new Step 6
   - Renumbered all subsequent steps (Step 7-14)

**Benefits:**
- Knowledge transfer between builds
- Learning from previous fix attempts
- Reduced repeated fix attempts
- Complete fix attempt history in BR documents

**See:**
- **[Release Workflow Agent Execution Guide](../../packages/frameworks/workflow%20mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md)** - Step 6 for the complete procedure
- **[Cursor Rules RW Trigger Section](../../packages/frameworks/workflow%20mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md)** - Step 6 for the updated agent execution rules
- **[BR Template](../../packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/BR_TEMPLATE.md)** - "Fix Attempt History" section
