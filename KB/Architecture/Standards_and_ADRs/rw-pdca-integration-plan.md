# Release Workflow PDCA Integration Plan

**Date:** 2025-12-03  
**Status:** Draft  
**Purpose:** Integrate Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle into Release Workflow  
**Related:** Document-Commit-Reflect pattern, Fix verification requirements

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration of the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** cycle into the Release Workflow (RW). PDCA provides a structured approach to continuous improvement, ensuring each release builds upon lessons learned from previous iterations.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Structured approach to continuous improvement
- ✅ Explicit verification and reflection phases
- ✅ Prevents "Attempted Fixes" from remaining unverified
- ✅ Creates learning loop for process improvement
- ✅ Aligns with Document-Commit-Reflect pattern

## PDCA Cycle Overview

### What is PDCA?

**Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** is a four-step iterative method for continuous improvement, also known as the **Deming Cycle** or **Shewhart Cycle**.

**The Four Phases:**

1. **PLAN** - Define objectives and plan changes
2. **DO** - Execute the plan on a small scale
3. **CHECK** - Evaluate results against objectives
4. **ACT** - Standardize successful practices or adjust based on results

### PDCA Principles

**Iterative:** PDCA is a continuous cycle - Act phase leads back to Plan phase  
**Data-Driven:** Decisions based on evidence and metrics  
**Small-Scale:** Test changes before full implementation  
**Learning-Oriented:** Each cycle builds knowledge

## Current RW Structure Analysis

### Current RW Steps (11 Steps)

**Phase 1: Version & Documentation Updates**
1. Branch Safety Check
2. Bump Version
3. Create Detailed Changelog
4. Update Main Changelog
5. Update README
6. Auto-update Kanban Docs

**Phase 2: Git Operations & Validation**
7. Stage Files
8. Run Validators
9. Commit Changes
10. Create Git Tag
11. Push to Remote

### Current Gap: Missing CHECK and ACT Phases

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No explicit post-commit verification step
- ❌ No reflection on whether changes worked
- ❌ No mechanism to update changelog after verification
- ❌ No learning loop for process improvement
- ❌ "Attempted Fixes" may remain unverified indefinitely

## PDCA Integration into RW

### Mapping PDCA to RW Steps

**PLAN Phase (Steps 1-3):**
- **Step 1:** Branch Safety Check - Plan what will be released
- **Step 2:** Bump Version - Plan version progression
- **Step 3:** Create Detailed Changelog - **Document intent** (what we plan to do)

**DO Phase (Steps 4-11):**
- **Steps 4-6:** Update documentation (README, Kanban)
- **Steps 7-8:** Validate and prepare
- **Steps 9-11:** **Execute** - Commit, tag, push

**CHECK Phase (NEW - Step 12):**
- **Step 12:** Post-Commit Verification & Reflection
  - Verify changes worked as expected
  - Evaluate against objectives
  - Document verification results

**ACT Phase (NEW - Step 13):**
- **Step 13:** Act on Verification Results
  - Update changelog based on verification
  - Standardize successful practices
  - Create follow-up tasks if needed

## Detailed PDCA Integration

### PLAN Phase: Document Intent

**Purpose:** Define what will be changed and why

**Current RW Steps:**
- **Step 1:** Branch Safety Check
  - Plan: What epic/story/task is being released
  - Validate: Work aligns with branch

- **Step 2:** Bump Version
  - Plan: Version progression (EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD)
  - Validate: Version matches work context

- **Step 3:** Create Detailed Changelog
  - **PLAN:** Document intent in changelog
  - **Format:** "Attempted fix for X" or "Address issue Y"
  - **Purpose:** Record what we plan to do and why

**PDCA Enhancement:**
- Add explicit "Plan" section to changelog
- Document objectives and expected outcomes
- Include verification plan (how we'll verify success)

### DO Phase: Execute Changes

**Purpose:** Implement planned changes

**Current RW Steps:**
- **Steps 4-6:** Update documentation
- **Steps 7-8:** Validate and prepare
- **Steps 9-11:** Commit, tag, push

**PDCA Enhancement:**
- Ensure commit messages match changelog intent
- Document what was actually done (may differ from plan)
- Record execution details for later evaluation

### CHECK Phase: Verify and Evaluate

**Purpose:** Verify changes worked and evaluate results

**NEW Step 12: Post-Commit Verification & Reflection**

**Process:**

1. **Verification Prompt:**
   - "Has this change been verified?"
   - Options: Verified / Unverified / Deferred

2. **Verification Methods:**
   - **Test Suite Execution:** Automated tests pass
   - **Manual Testing:** Documented test results
   - **Observation Period:** For behavior changes
   - **Defer Verification:** Explicit decision with plan

3. **Evaluation Questions:**
   - Did the change work as expected?
   - Did it solve the problem?
   - Are there side effects?
   - What did we learn?

4. **Documentation:**
   - Record verification results
   - Document what worked/didn't work
   - Capture lessons learned

**Changelog Update:**
- If verified: Move from "Attempted Fix" to "Fixed"
- If failed: Document what didn't work
- If deferred: Document verification plan

### ACT Phase: Standardize or Adjust

**Purpose:** Act on verification results

**NEW Step 13: Act on Verification Results**

**Process:**

1. **If Verified (Success):**
   - Update changelog: Move to "Fixed" section
   - Document verification evidence
   - Standardize successful practices
   - Create new release if needed

2. **If Failed:**
   - Document what didn't work
   - Identify root causes
   - Create follow-up task
   - Plan next iteration

3. **If Deferred:**
   - Document verification plan
   - Schedule verification
   - Create reminder task

4. **Process Improvement:**
   - Reflect on RW process itself
   - Identify improvements
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update RW documentation if needed
