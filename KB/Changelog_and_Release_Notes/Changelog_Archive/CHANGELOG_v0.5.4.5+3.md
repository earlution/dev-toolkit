## Summary

Enhanced the framework dependency installation guide with comprehensive Git repository setup prerequisites. The guide now addresses users who haven't set up a GitHub repository yet, with detailed instructions for local Git repository initialization and optional GitHub setup. All installation methods now include explicit Git initialization steps, and a new troubleshooting section addresses common Git repository issues.

## Changes

### 📚 Prerequisites Section Enhancement

**Added comprehensive "Setting Up a Git Repository" section:**
- Local Git repository initialization instructions with step-by-step commands
- GitHub repository setup (optional, with clear explanation of when it's needed)
- Git setup verification steps to ensure everything is configured correctly
- Clarified that local Git repository is sufficient; GitHub is optional but recommended

**Key additions:**
- Step-by-step instructions for `git init` and initial commit
- Instructions for connecting to GitHub (both HTTPS and SSH)
- Clear explanation of when GitHub is needed vs. optional
- Verification commands to check Git setup

### 🔧 Installation Methods Updates

**Added Git initialization step to all three installation methods:**

1. **Method 1 (Git Submodules):**
   - Added Step 1: "Ensure Git repository is initialized"
   - Includes `git init` check and verification
   - Renumbered subsequent steps accordingly

2. **Method 2 (CLI Tool):**
   - Added Step 1: "Ensure Git repository is initialized"
   - Includes `git init` check and verification
   - Renumbered subsequent steps accordingly

3. **Method 3 (Package Managers):**
   - Added Step 1 for both npm and pip: "Ensure Git repository is initialized"
   - Includes `git init` check and verification
   - Added note explaining why Git is still recommended even when using package managers

### 🐛 Troubleshooting Section

**Added "Issue: Not a Git repository" section:**
- Problem description: `git status` shows "not a git repository" error
- Solution steps: Initialize Git repository and create initial commit
- Clarifies that frameworks can be installed with just a local Git repository
- Notes that remote repository (GitHub) is not required for installation

### ✅ Verification Section Enhancement

**Enhanced Git integration checks:**
- Added Git repository status check to verification steps
- Added remote repository check (if configured) with `git remote -v`
- Updated submodule status check to include context about Git repository

### 📝 Package Manager Notes

**Added explanatory note for package managers:**
- Explains why Git is still recommended even when using npm/pip
- Lists benefits: version control, framework version tracking, CI/CD integration, update workflows
- Clarifies that while not strictly required, Git provides significant value

## Impact

### User Experience
- **Eliminates confusion:** Users now know exactly what to do if they don't have a Git repository yet
- **Reduces friction:** Clear step-by-step instructions prevent installation failures
- **Sets expectations:** Users understand that local Git is sufficient, GitHub is optional

### Documentation Quality
- **More comprehensive:** Covers the full setup process from scratch
- **Better structure:** Prerequisites section now includes actionable setup steps
- **Improved troubleshooting:** Common issue (no Git repo) now has dedicated solution

### Technical Accuracy
- **Correct workflow:** All installation methods now start with Git initialization
- **Consistent approach:** Same Git setup steps across all three methods
- **Clear guidance:** Distinguishes between required (local Git) and optional (GitHub) components

## Files Changed

- `KB/Documentation/User_Docs/framework-dependency-installation-guide.md` - Enhanced with Git repository setup prerequisites
- `src/fynd_deals/version.py` - Version bumped to `0.5.4.5+3`
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added entry for v0.5.4.5+3

---

## Testing Notes

This update addresses a real-world scenario where users may not have set up a GitHub repository yet. The documentation now provides clear guidance for:

1. **New projects:** Users starting from scratch can follow the complete setup process
2. **Existing projects:** Users with existing projects can verify their Git setup
3. **GitHub-less workflows:** Users can install frameworks with just local Git repositories

**Recommended testing:**
- Follow the installation guide from a fresh project directory
- Test Git initialization steps
- Verify that frameworks can be installed without a GitHub remote
- Confirm that all three installation methods include Git setup steps

## Related Work

- **Task:** E05:S04:T05 – Create comprehensive user documentation for Epic 6 framework dependency architecture
- **Story:** E5:S04 – Framework Documentation Management
- **Epic:** E5 – Documentation Management and Maintenance

## Next Steps

The installation guide is now comprehensive and addresses the Git repository setup prerequisite. Users can proceed with framework installation following the enhanced guide.

**Future enhancements:**
- Consider adding a quick-start guide for users who already have Git set up
- May want to add a "Check if you have Git" verification step earlier in the prerequisites
- Could add a troubleshooting section for Git configuration issues (user.name, user.email)
