  6. **Review Schedules** - Epic, Story, Board, and Policy review cadences
  7. **Maintenance Responsibilities** - Clear ownership for Epic owners, Story owners, Kanban maintainers, Framework maintainers
  8. **Escalation Procedures** - Documentation inconsistencies, missing reviews, policy violations, blocked workflows
  9. **Mandatory TODO Tracking** - Real-time progress visibility for agent-driven workflows

- ✅ Updated **dev-kit local policy** (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md`):
  - Enhanced "Relationship to Framework Package" section
  - Explicitly states framework policy is **CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH**
  - Documents relationship between framework policy (SoT) and project-specific adaptations
  - Lists all 9 Operational Principles sections for reference

- ✅ Updated **Story 001** (`Story-001-dev-kit-kanban-implementation.md`):

## 📝 Notes

The framework policy now serves as the comprehensive canonical SoT with all operational principles explicitly documented. This establishes a solid foundation for T004 (Align dev-kit Kanban templates with updated governance) and T005 (Document consumption pattern for other projects).

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **T004:** Align dev-kit Kanban templates with updated governance
  - Add notes about "ALL sections" requirement
  - Add forensic marker format standardization notes
  - Add consistency reminders
- **T005:** Document consumption pattern for other projects
  - Explain how projects should copy and adapt the updated policy
  - Document customization boundaries
