# Release v0.4.2.2+1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-02 00:00:00 UTC

**Epic / Story / Task:** Epic 4, Story 2, Task 2  
**Type:** 📚 Documentation

---

## 📋 Summary

This release completes **Task 2: Design FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic decision flow**. A comprehensive decision flow design has been created, including step-by-step processes, matching criteria, edge case handling, and integration rules for converting Feature Requests and Bug Reports into Kanban Tasks, Stories, and Epics.

---

## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 2 Completion

- ✅ **Decision Flow Design Document Created:**
  - High-level flow overview
  - Detailed step-by-step process (6 steps)
  - Story matching criteria (primary and secondary)
  - Epic matching criteria (primary and secondary)
  - Epic creation guidelines (broad, abstract, examples)
  - Edge case handling (5 scenarios)
  - Versioning integration rules
  - Kanban board integration rules
  - Visual decision flow diagram (text-based flowchart)
  - Decision criteria summary table
  - Worked examples (4 scenarios)

### Key Components

**Decision Flow Steps:**
1. **Receive FR/BR** - Classify and extract information
2. **Search for Existing Story** - Match scope, Epic alignment, status
3. **Create Task Under Story** (if Story found) - Assign version `RC.EPIC.STORY.{NEXT_TASK}+1`
4. **Search for Existing Epic** (if no Story) - Match domain, status
5. **Create Story Under Epic** (if Epic found) - Assign version `RC.EPIC.{NEXT_STORY}.1+1`
6. **Create New Epic** (if no Epic) - Assign version `RC.{NEXT_EPIC}.1.1+1`

**Matching Criteria Defined:**
- **Story Matching:** Scope alignment, Epic alignment, status compatibility
- **Epic Matching:** Domain alignment, status compatibility, conceptual fit
- **Epic Creation:** Broad and abstract, problem domain focused, future-proof

**Edge Cases Handled:**
1. Complex FR requiring multiple Tasks
2. Ambiguous scope
3. BR affecting multiple components
4. FR/BR spanning multiple Epics
5. Duplicate FR/BR

**Integration Points:**
- Versioning: Rules for `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` assignment
- Kanban: Board update rules and status synchronization
- Release Workflow: Compatibility and forensic marker integration

### Key Documentation

**Decision Flow Design:**
- Complete step-by-step process for FR/BR intake
- Clear decision criteria for Story and Epic matching
- Guidelines for Epic creation (broad, abstract concepts)
- Comprehensive edge case handling
- Versioning integration rules
- Visual flowcharts (text-based)

**Examples Provided:**
1. Simple FR → Existing Story (Task 4 under Story 2)
2. FR → New Story (Existing Epic) (Story 3, Task 1)
3. FR → New Epic (Epic 5, Story 1, Task 1)
4. Complex FR → Multiple Tasks (cross-Epic coordination)

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- The decision flow needs to be clear and unambiguous to support both AI agents and human users. The step-by-step process with explicit criteria makes the intake process systematic and repeatable.
- Edge cases are common in real-world scenarios. Handling complex FRs, ambiguous scope, and cross-Epic work requires clear guidelines and documentation.
- Integration with versioning and Kanban is critical. The decision flow must ensure proper version assignment and board updates at each step.
