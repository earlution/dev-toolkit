## DO Phase

### Added
- **New RW Step 6: Update BR/FR Docs** - Added before "Auto-update Kanban Docs" (now Step 7)
  - Purpose: Document flaws, attempted fixes, and verification status in BR/FR docs

  - For Feature Requests: Updates "Intake Decision" section with implementation status
  - Enables knowledge transfer between builds when bugs aren't squashed

- **BR Template Enhancement** - Added "Fix Attempt History" section to `BR_TEMPLATE.md`
  - Includes fields for: Fix Description, Changes Made, Verification Status, Result, Lessons Learned, Next Steps
  - Creates knowledge base for future fix attempts

- **Workflow Flaw Documentation** - Added WF-003 to `workflow-flaws-reference-guide.md`
  - Documented anti-pattern: Fix attempts not documented in BR/FR docs
  - Root cause analysis: RW lacked step to update BR/FR documents
  - Solution: New RW Step 6 added to document fix attempts

### Changed
- **RW Documentation Updated** - Renumbered all steps after new Step 6
  - `release-workflow-agent-execution.md`: Added Step 6, renumbered Steps 7-14

  - Steps 13-14: Optional (PDCA CHECK and ACT phases)

### Fixed
- **Knowledge Transfer Gap** - Fixed workflow flaw where fix attempts weren't documented in BR/FR docs
  - Previous builds couldn't learn from previous fix attempts
  - New Step 6 ensures each build is informed by previous attempts

- **Story:** Story 3 - Versioning Integration with Kanban & RW

- **Workflow Flaw:** WF-003 - BR/FR Fix Attempts Not Documented

---

## Notes

This release addresses a critical workflow gap where fix attempts weren't being documented in Bug Reports and Feature Requests. The new Step 6 ensures that:

1. **Knowledge Transfer:** Each build can learn from previous fix attempts
2. **Reduced Repetition:** Avoids repeating failed approaches
3. **Complete History:** All fix attempts documented in BR documents
4. **Better Debugging:** Clear record of what was tried and why it didn't work

The implementation follows the established pattern of documenting workflow flaws and their solutions, ensuring the Release Workflow continues to harden over time.
