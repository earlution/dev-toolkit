#### Story 6: Comprehensive Canonical Epics/Stories/Tasks Template System

**Task 0: Story creation and comprehensive structure documentation** (Build 1)
- **Comprehensive Canonical Structure:** Created complete E/S/T structure document
  - Framework epics (1-7) with Epic 7 as UXR
  - Project-specific canonical epics (8-21+)
  - ~50+ stories and ~300+ tasks defined
  - Scalability guidance and contextualization system
- **Design Documentation:** Created comprehensive design document
  - Problem statement and rationale
  - Epic 7 (UXR) rationale
  - Epic ordering rationale
  - Implementation requirements
- **Story 6 Created:** Defined 8 implementation tasks
  - T01-T02: Epic template creation
  - T03-T04: Story and task template creation
  - T05: Contextualization guide
  - T06: Documentation updates
  - T07: Integration with setup guide
  - T08: Validation with test projects

**Implementation Details:**

**New Files:**
- `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete canonical structure (Epics 1-21+)
  - Framework epics (1-7): Always included
  - Project-specific canonical epics (8-21+): Add as needed
  - Epic 7: User Experience Research (UXR) - NEW canonical epic
  - ~50+ stories and ~300+ tasks defined
  - Scalability guidance (tiny → ambitious projects)
  - Contextualization system with placeholders
- `KB/Documentation/Engineering_and_Platform/comprehensive-canonical-est-structure-design.md` - Design documentation
  - Problem statement (BR-004, FR-005)
  - Solution design overview
  - Rationale for Epic 7 (UXR) as canonical
  - Epic ordering rationale
  - Scalability design
  - Contextualization system
  - Implementation requirements (4 phases)
- `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-4/Story-006-comprehensive-canonical-est-template-system.md` - Story 6 document
  - 8 tasks defined for implementation
  - Complete task descriptions and acceptance criteria

**Enhanced Files:**
- `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-4/Epic-4.md` - Added Story 6
- `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/kanban-board.md` - Added Story 6, updated status to IN PROGRESS
- `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/_index.md` - Updated Epic 4 status and progress

**Key Decisions:**

**Epic 7: UXR as Canonical Epic:**
- Added User Experience Research (UXR) as Epic 7
- Rationale: Bridges framework (Epics 1-6) and project work (Epics 8+)
- Universal need across all projects
- Supports user-centered design practices
- Integrates with FR/BR intake (UXR findings → FRs/BRs)

**Epic Ordering:**
- Foundational → Operational frameworks → Implementation → UXR → Project-specific
- Epic 7 (UXR) bridges framework and project work
- Codebase Maintenance moved to Epic 8 (project-specific canonical pattern)
- All project-specific epics renumbered (8→9, 9→10, etc.)

**Scalability:**
- Tiny projects: Epics 1-7 only
- Small projects: Epics 1-7 + 1-3 project epics
- Medium projects: Epics 1-7 + 3-5 project epics
- Ambitious projects: Full structure (Epics 1-21+)
