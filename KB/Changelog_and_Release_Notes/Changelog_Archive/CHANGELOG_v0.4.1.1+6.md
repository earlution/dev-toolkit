## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 5 Completion

- ✅ Added **comprehensive "Consumption Pattern for Other Projects" section** to `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md`:
  - **Why copy, don't reference:** Independence, customization, ownership rationale
  - **What to copy:** Required vs optional files list
  - **Customization boundaries:** Clear guidance on what can vs must not customize
  - **Update process:** Step-by-step workflow for syncing with framework updates
  - **Single Source of Truth relationship:** Framework as canonical SoT, projects as adaptations
  - **Implementation steps:** Complete step-by-step guide for new projects
  - **Example: New project setup:** Practical example for "myapp" project
  - **Key principles:** Summary of critical consumption principles

- ✅ Updated **Story 001** (`Story-001-dev-kit-kanban-implementation.md`):
  - Marked Task 5 as complete in task checklist
  - Updated task details with completion status and summary

### Key Documentation

**Copy, Don't Reference Pattern:**
- Projects MUST copy files into their own repository
- Projects must NOT link or reference `vibe-dev-kit` files
- Each project owns its Kanban implementation

**Customization Boundaries:**
- ✅ **CAN customize:** File paths, project names, terminology, Epic ranges, branch conventions, board structure
- ❌ **MUST NOT customize:** Operational principles, forensic marker format, Story Checklist as SoT, governance rules, version schema structure

**Update Process:**
- When to update (new principles, enhancements, fixes)
- How to update (review, compare, selectively merge)
- Manual merge process with preservation of customizations

**SoT Relationship:**
- `vibe-dev-kit` is canonical source of truth
- Project implementations are adaptations
- Documentation pattern for referencing framework

**Implementation Guide:**
- Step-by-step instructions for copying framework
- Customization checklist
- First Epic and Story creation
- Integration with versioning and workflows
- Customization documentation

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- The consumption pattern documentation provides clear guidance for projects adopting the Kanban framework.
- The "copy, don't reference" pattern ensures project independence while maintaining alignment with framework principles.
- Customization boundaries clearly distinguish what can be adapted (paths, names) from what must remain intact (principles, rules).
- The update process enables projects to stay aligned with framework improvements while preserving their customizations.
