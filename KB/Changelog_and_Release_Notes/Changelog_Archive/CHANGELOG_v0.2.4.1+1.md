# Changelog v0.2.4.1+1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-04 10:29:01 UTC
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Workflow Management Framework
**Story:** Story 4 - RW Installer & Plug-and-Play Adoption
**Task:** Task 1 - Analyze current RW adoption friction and required config
**Type:** 📊 Analysis

## PLAN Phase

### Objectives
- Analyze current RW adoption process across projects
- Identify all manual integration touchpoints and pain points
- Define the minimal configuration needed for a project-level RW config
- Prepare for design of `rw-config.yaml` and installer CLI

### Expected Outcomes
- Clear list of RW integration touchpoints (version file, changelog, Kanban, scripts, docs)
- Minimal set of configuration keys for `rw-config.yaml`
- Decisions on what remains hard-coded vs configurable
- Input for subsequent tasks (T02–T05) in Story 4

### Verification Plan
- Review analysis document for completeness and clarity
- Cross-check touchpoints against existing RW docs, scripts, and YAML
- Confirm config key set covers all project-specific needs without unnecessary complexity

## Summary
📊 Analysis: Task 1 complete – Analyzed current RW adoption friction and defined required configuration keys for RW installer

## Changes

### Added
- Story scaffold and analysis scope for RW installer story:
  - `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-2/stories/Story-004-rw-installer-and-plug-and-play-adoption.md`
    - Defined Story 4 overview and goals
    - Defined Task Checklist for T01–T05
    - Scoped T01 analysis work (integration touchpoints and config keys)

### Notes
- This release captures the planning and analysis foundation for the RW installer
- No code or workflow logic changes yet; this is preparatory analysis work
- Subsequent tasks (T02–T05) will build on this analysis to design the config schema, implement the installer CLI, create quickstart docs, and usability test
