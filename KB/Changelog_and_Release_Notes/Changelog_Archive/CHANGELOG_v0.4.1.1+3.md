## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 2 Completion

- ✅ Created **findings document** (`T002-fynd-deals-epic15-kanban-findings.md`)
  - Extracted 7 reusable patterns from framework packages:
    1. Atomic Release Workflow (RW) Behaviour Pattern
    2. "ALL Sections" Update Requirement Pattern
    3. Accessibility Constraints Pattern
    4. Forensic Marker Requirements and Consistency Checks Pattern
    5. Review Schedules and Maintenance Responsibilities Pattern
    6. Escalation Procedures Pattern
    7. Mandatory TODO Tracking Pattern
  - Identified patterns already in framework vs. missing from policy
  - Provided 9 high-priority recommendations for `kanban-governance-policy.md`
  - Provided medium-priority recommendations for templates

- ✅ Updated **Story 001** (`Story-001-dev-kit-kanban-implementation.md`)
  - Marked Task 2 as complete in task checklist
  - Updated task details with completion status and findings summary

### Key Findings

**Patterns Already in Framework Packages:**
- ✅ Atomic RW Behaviour - Documented in workflow management package
- ✅ "ALL Sections" Requirement - Documented in workflow-Kanban integration guide
- ✅ Mandatory TODO Tracking - Documented in workflow management package
- ✅ Forensic Marker Format - Shown in examples throughout framework
- ✅ Accessibility Constraints - Implicitly documented in workflow management package

**Patterns Missing from Kanban Governance Policy:**
- ❌ Atomic RW Behaviour - Not explicitly documented in `kanban-governance-policy.md`
- ❌ "ALL Sections" Requirement - Not explicitly documented in `kanban-governance-policy.md`
- ❌ Accessibility Constraints - Not explicitly documented in `kanban-governance-policy.md`
- ❌ Forensic Marker Standardization - Format shown but not explicitly standardized
- ❌ Consistency Requirements - Mentioned but not detailed
- ❌ Review Schedules - Not documented
- ❌ Escalation Procedures - Not documented

**Recommendations:**
- **High Priority:** Add 9 explicit sections to `kanban-governance-policy.md`:
  1. Atomic RW Behaviour Section
  2. "ALL Sections" Update Requirement Section
  3. Accessibility Constraints Section
  4. Forensic Marker Standardization Section
  5. Consistency Requirements Section
  6. Review Schedules Section
  7. Maintenance Responsibilities Section
  8. Escalation Procedures Section
  9. Mandatory TODO Tracking Section
- **Medium Priority:** Update templates with notes about "ALL sections" requirement, forensic marker format, and consistency reminders

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- The framework packages (`packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/` and `packages/frameworks/kanban/`) already contain many fynd.deals Epic 15 findings, particularly in workflow management integration docs.
- However, critical operational principles are not yet explicitly documented in the Kanban governance policy itself.
- The findings document provides a clear roadmap for making the Kanban governance policy comprehensive and explicit.
- All 7 patterns identified are essential for maintaining documentation consistency, accessibility, and operational clarity.
