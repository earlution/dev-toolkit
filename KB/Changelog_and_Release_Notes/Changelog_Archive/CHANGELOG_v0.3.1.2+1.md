## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 2 Completion

- ✅ Created **findings document** (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-3/stories/Story-001-dev-kit-alignment-with-versioning-framework/T002-fynd-deals-epic15-findings.md`)
  - Analyzed versioning patterns from `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/` package
  - Extracted 12 reusable patterns (8 fully portable, 3 project-specific)
  - Documented key findings and recommendations
  - Identified that framework package already contains fynd.deals Epic 15 findings

- ✅ Updated **Story 001** (`Story-001-dev-kit-alignment-with-versioning-framework.md`)
  - Marked Task 2 as complete in task checklist
  - Updated task details with completion status and findings reference
  - Added reference to findings document in References section

### Key Findings Documented

**12 Reusable Patterns Identified:**
1. Version Schema: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` format
2. Epic Renumbering Strategy (project-specific pattern)
3. Version File Structure (component-based)
4. Two-Layer CHANGELOG System
5. Canonical Ordering Principle (version numbers, not timestamps)
6. Forensic Traceability Grid (multi-dimensional)
7. Immutability Rules (historical metadata preservation)
8. Date Format Patterns (two-layer date system)
9. Grandfathering Strategy (legacy format preservation)
10. Validation Scripts (automated format enforcement)
11. Version File Location Pattern (standardized location)
12. Branch Context Validation (version matches branch/epic)

**Recommendations:**
- Update version file location from `src/fynd_deals/version.py` to `src/vibe_dev_kit/version.py`
- Framework package completeness confirmed (already contains fynd.deals Epic 15 findings)
- Dev-kit versioning policy alignment verified
