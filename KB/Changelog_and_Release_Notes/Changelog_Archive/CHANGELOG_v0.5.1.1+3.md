### 📋 Task Planning

**Documentation Update Triggers Task (E5:S01:T04):**
- Expanded task definition with comprehensive approach
- Identified 5 categories of documentation update events:
  1. Code Changes (features, bugs, APIs, breaking changes)
  2. Workflow Changes (RW execution, step modifications)
  3. Policy & Framework Changes (versioning, Kanban, templates)
  4. Project Structure Changes (Epics/Stories, file reorganization)
  5. Documentation-Specific Events (gaps, errors, inconsistencies)
- Defined 3 types of trigger conditions:
  - Automatic triggers (RW-integrated: Steps 6-7)
  - Manual triggers (developer-initiated)
  - Scheduled triggers (time-based reviews)
- Created update procedures for each trigger type:
  - Automatic RW triggers (Steps 6-7 procedures)
  - Code change triggers (API docs, README, examples, guides)
  - Policy change triggers (policy docs, framework docs, integration guides)
  - Structure change triggers (structure docs, path references, navigation)
  - Manual review triggers (task creation, assignment, review process)
- Specified deliverables:
  - Documentation update triggers reference guide
  - Trigger procedures document
  - Integration guide (RW and Kanban)
  - Trigger tracking and notification system documentation

## Problem Solved

## Notes

The comprehensive trigger definition integrates with existing Release Workflow automatic updates (Steps 6-7) and Kanban FR/BR flow for manual documentation issues. All trigger types are now clearly defined with procedures and deliverables.
