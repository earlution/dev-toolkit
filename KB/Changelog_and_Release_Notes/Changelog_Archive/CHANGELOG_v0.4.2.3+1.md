## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- Templates need to capture enough information to support the decision flow from T002. The scope analysis and affected component sections help with Story/Epic matching.
- The Intake Decision section provides a clear audit trail from FR/BR to Task/Story/Epic, supporting forensic traceability.
- BR template's fix verification status aligns with RW requirements, ensuring fixes are verified before being marked as "Fixed" in changelogs.
