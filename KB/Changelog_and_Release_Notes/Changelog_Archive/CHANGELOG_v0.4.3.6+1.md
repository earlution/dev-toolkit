**Epic / Story / Task:** Epic 4, Story 3, Task 6  
**Type:** 📚 Documentation

---

## 📋 Summary

This release completes **Task 6: Document integration examples and edge cases**. A comprehensive examples and edge cases document has been created, providing worked examples and edge case documentation for the three-way integration between Kanban, Versioning, and Release Workflow in the dev-kit.

---

## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 6 Completion

- ✅ **Integration Examples and Edge Cases Document Created:**
  - Documented 4 worked examples with step-by-step flows
  - Documented 6 edge cases with solutions
  - Added troubleshooting section with 4 common issues
  - Added best practices summary

- ✅ **Worked Examples:**
  - Example 1: FR → Task → Version → RW → Kanban update (complete 6-step flow)
  - Example 2: Multiple Tasks in same Story (7 Tasks example with version sequence)
  - Example 3: Story completion across multiple Tasks (completion process)
  - Example 4: Epic progression (3 Stories example with version progression)

- ✅ **Edge Cases:**
  - Edge Case 1: Parallel Epic development (version conflict prevention)
  - Edge Case 2: Task renumbering (immutability principle, version mapping)
  - Edge Case 3: Story renumbering (immutability principle, version mapping)
  - Edge Case 4: Version conflicts (prevention and resolution)
  - Edge Case 5: Skipped Task numbers (gap handling)
  - Edge Case 6: Multiple Builds for same Task (BUILD increment example)

- ✅ **Troubleshooting:**
  - Version TASK Component Not Updating
  - Epic Story Checklist Not Updated
  - Version Conflicts During Merge
  - Task Renumbering Breaks Version Traceability

### Worked Examples

**Example 1: FR → Task → Version → RW → Kanban Update**
- Complete 6-step flow from FR arrival to Git push
- Demonstrates version assignment, RW execution, Kanban updates
- Shows forensic marker creation and traceability

**Example 2: Multiple Tasks in Same Story**
- 7 Tasks example (T001-T008) with version sequence
- Shows Task transitions and BUILD resets
- Demonstrates Epic Story Checklist format with Task completion list

**Example 3: Story Completion**
- Story completion process across multiple Tasks
- Shows how Story status changes from IN PROGRESS to COMPLETE
- Demonstrates forensic marker placement

**Example 4: Epic Progression**
- 3 Stories example (S01, S02, S03) with version progression
- Shows how Epic progresses through Stories
- Demonstrates version schema with Story increments

### Edge Cases

**Parallel Epic Development:**
- How version schema enables parallel development
- Version conflict prevention through EPIC component
- Canonical ordering by version number, not commit time

**Task/Story Renumbering:**
- Immutability principle for version numbers
- How to handle renumbering without changing versions
- Documentation requirements for renumbering

**Version Conflicts:**
- Prevention through workflow design
- Resolution process if conflicts occur
- Best practices for avoiding conflicts

**Skipped Task Numbers:**
- How gaps in Task numbers are handled
- Version numbers reflect gaps (no special handling needed)
- Documentation for skipped numbers

**Multiple Builds:**
- How BUILD increments for iterations within same Task
- When to use BUILD vs TASK increments
- Examples of multiple builds for same Task

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- **Worked Examples:** Step-by-step examples demonstrate real-world integration flows with dev-kit specific paths and versions.
- **Edge Cases:** Edge cases are documented with solutions based on immutability principles and workflow design.
- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues are documented with symptoms, solutions, and references to validation reports.
- **Best Practices:** Clear DOs and DON'Ts help maintain integration integrity.
