# Changelog: v0.5.4.8+1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-07 23:45:00 UTC

**Story:** Story 4 - Framework Documentation Management  
**Task:** E05:S04:T08 - Document `.cursorrules` setup for RW trigger  
**Version:** 0.5.4.8+1

---

## Summary

## Problem Addressed

**Issue:** Users installing the Workflow Management framework were not aware they needed to configure `.cursorrules` for the "RW" command to work in Cursor. This was identified when a user on the `been-there` project reported that the RW trigger wasn't working, and the agent correctly identified that the `.cursorrules` file didn't exist.

**Impact:** This was a critical adoption barrier - without `.cursorrules` setup, users couldn't use the primary feature of the Workflow Management framework (the RW trigger).

**Solution:** Added comprehensive documentation across three user-facing documents:
1. Installation guide - proactive setup instructions
2. Troubleshooting guide - reactive problem-solving
3. FAQ - quick reference
