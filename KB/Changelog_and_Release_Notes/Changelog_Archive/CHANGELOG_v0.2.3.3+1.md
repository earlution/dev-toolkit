- Backup and rollback procedures documented

### Verification Plan
- Review YAML structure matches Release Workflow pattern
- Verify execution guide follows agent-driven pattern
- Check examples are clear and project-agnostic
- Verify backup and rollback procedures are documented
- Manual review of workflow completeness

## Summary
🚀 Feature: Task 3 complete - Created Migration Workflow example with YAML and execution guide

## Changes

### Added
- Migration Workflow YAML: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/migration-workflow.yaml`
  - 13-step workflow for systematic migrations (code, database, dependency, infrastructure)
  - 5 phases: Analysis & Planning, Preparation, Execution, Validation, Documentation & Git Operations
  - Configurable parameters for migration type and target component
  - Backup and rollback support
- Migration Workflow Agent Execution Guide: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/migration-workflow-agent-execution.md`
  - Step-by-step execution guide for all 13 steps
  - Agent-driven execution pattern (ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED)
  - Examples for each step
  - Progress tracking with Cursor TODOs
  - Backup and rollback procedures

### Notes
- Migration Workflow demonstrates agent-driven execution for migration workflows
- Follows same pattern as Release Workflow (canonical example)
- All examples are project-agnostic and portable
- Workflow includes validation steps (migration validation, test suite, functionality verification)
- Backup and rollback support ensures safe migrations

- Supports multiple migration types (code, database, dependency, infrastructure)
- Includes backup creation before migration
- Includes rollback plan and procedure
- Validation steps ensure migration correctness
- Documentation and git operations integrated
- Post-migration verification and results documentation
