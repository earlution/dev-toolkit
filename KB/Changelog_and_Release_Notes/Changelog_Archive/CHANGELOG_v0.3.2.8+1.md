### E3:S02:T08 – Audit dual-versioning application across packages and propose strategy

**Status:** TODO (Task created)

**Task Created:**
- Created comprehensive task definition in Story 2
- Defined scope: Audit all packages, investigate current versioning state, propose strategy
- Identified key concerns: SemVer continuity, mapping strategy appropriateness, package-specific needs

**Key Requirements:**
- Inventory all packages and their current versioning state
- Report on each package's package version (if it has one)
- Investigate Workflow Management package versioning (user mentioned 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 pattern)
- Analyze dual-versioning strategy applicability for package management
- Address SemVer continuity concerns (generated SemVers may not follow-on numerically)
- Propose solution for consistent, reliable package versioning

**Deliverables Defined:**
- Comprehensive audit report for each package
- Analysis of current versioning patterns
- Assessment of dual-versioning strategy for package management context
- Proposed solution addressing SemVer continuity and mapping strategy concerns

## 📝 Notes

- Task addresses user concern that dual-versioning strategy may not be appropriate for package management
- Key insight: Generated SemVers from RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD may not follow-on numerically, breaking package version history continuity
- Task will investigate if packages need independent SemVer tracking vs. derived SemVer from project version
- Workflow Management package mentioned as having version pattern (1.0, 1.1, 1.2) - needs investigation
- Task will propose solution that ensures package versions make sense independently while maintaining traceability to project version
