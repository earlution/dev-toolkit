## ✅ Completed Work

### E2:S05:T01 – Plan PIR workflow structure and requirements

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Deliverables:**
- Created comprehensive planning document: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Analysis/PIR-workflow-planning.md`

- Both auto and manual reviewer assignment supported
- Auto-create follow-up Kanban tasks from PIR findings
- KB structure defined (impacts KB package)
- Use project versioning (no separate PIR versioning)
- Approval support but not default
- Integration depth follows value-add principle

**Planning Document Status:** `DESIGN READY`
