- Comprehensive agent execution guide
- Clear examples and use cases
- Workflow ready for adoption in other projects

### Verification Plan
- Review YAML structure matches Release Workflow pattern
- Verify execution guide follows agent-driven pattern
- Check examples are clear and project-agnostic
- Manual review of workflow completeness

## Summary
🚀 Feature: Task 2 complete - Created Refactor Workflow example with YAML and execution guide

## Changes

### Added
- Refactor Workflow YAML: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/refactor-workflow.yaml`
  - 13-step workflow for systematic code refactoring
  - 4 phases: Analysis & Planning, Execution, Validation, Documentation & Git Operations
  - Configurable parameters for refactoring type and target module
- Refactor Workflow Agent Execution Guide: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/refactor-workflow-agent-execution.md`
  - Step-by-step execution guide for all 13 steps
  - Agent-driven execution pattern (ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED)
  - Examples for each step
  - Progress tracking with Cursor TODOs

### Notes
- Refactor Workflow demonstrates agent-driven execution for code quality workflows
- Follows same pattern as Release Workflow (canonical example)
- All examples are project-agnostic and portable
- Workflow includes validation steps (linting, type checking, testing)

## Related Tasks
- E2:S03:T02 – Create Refactor Workflow example ✅ COMPLETE

## Technical Details
- 13-step workflow organized into 4 phases
- Supports multiple refactoring types (structural, naming, extraction, simplification, performance)
- Includes validation steps (linting, type checking, test suite)
- Documentation and git operations integrated
- Post-refactor verification and results documentation
