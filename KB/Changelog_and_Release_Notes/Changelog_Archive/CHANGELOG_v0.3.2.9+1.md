## ✅ Completed Work

### E3:S02:T09 – Implement Package Version Workflow (PVW) with agentic execution

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ **PVW Workflow Definition:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/package-version-workflow.yaml`
  - 6-step workflow definition
  - Integrated as RW Step 2.5
  - Config-driven approach

- ✅ **PVW Agent Execution Guide:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/package-version-workflow-agent-execution.md`
  - Complete step-by-step agent execution guide
  - ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern for each step
  - Comprehensive TODO tracking requirements (drift prevention)
  - Examples and case studies

- ✅ **Validation Scripts (Tools):** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/package/`
  - `validate_package_version_format.py` - SemVer format validation
  - `validate_package_version_increment.py` - Version increment validation
  - `validate_package_version_consistency.py` - Version consistency across locations
  - `get_package_changes.py` - Change analysis (data gathering)

- ✅ **RW Integration:** Updated `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/release-workflow.yaml`
  - Added PVW as Step 2.5 (after project version bump, before changelog)
  - Executes automatically during RW

- ✅ **Cursor Rules Section:** Updated `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md`
  - Added PVW trigger section
  - Comprehensive TODO tracking requirements
  - Agentic execution pattern documentation

- ✅ **Version Bump Criteria:** `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/package-versioning-criteria.md`
  - MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH criteria documented as guidance (not hard rules)
  - Examples and decision patterns
  - Agent decision-making process

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Agent-driven execution (intelligent analysis, not deterministic scripts)
- ✅ Validation scripts as tools (provide data, not make decisions)
- ✅ Criteria as guidance (inform decisions, not dictate them)
- ✅ Context-aware analysis (understand actual changes and impact)
- ✅ Comprehensive TODO tracking (drift prevention)
- ✅ Clear documentation and reasoning

**Package Version Updates:**
- **Workflow Management:** 2.0.0 → 2.1.0 (MINOR) - Added Package Version Workflow (PVW)

## 📝 Notes

This release implements the Package Version Workflow (PVW) following the proven agentic execution pattern established by the Release Workflow. PVW provides intelligent, context-aware package versioning with comprehensive validation and drift prevention through TODO tracking.

The implementation emphasizes:
- **Intelligent Analysis:** Agent analyzes actual changes, not mechanical rules
- **Validation as Tools:** Scripts provide checks and data, not decisions
- **Criteria as Guidance:** Criteria inform decisions, not dictate them
- **Drift Prevention:** Comprehensive TODO tracking prevents workflow drift

This approach has proven orders of magnitude better than deterministic scripts in the Release Workflow, and PVW follows the same pattern for consistent success.
