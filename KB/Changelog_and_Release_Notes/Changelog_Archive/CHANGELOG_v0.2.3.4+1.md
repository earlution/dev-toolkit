**Release Date:** 2025-12-03 17:29:10 UTC
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Workflow Management Framework
**Story:** Story 3 - Additional Workflows & Examples
**Task:** Task 4 - Create Testing Workflow example
**Type:** 🚀 Feature

## PLAN Phase

### Objectives
- Create Testing Workflow YAML definition
- Create Testing Workflow agent execution guide
- Provide examples of testing workflow usage
- Demonstrate agent-driven execution pattern for testing workflows
- Include coverage tracking and quality validation

### Expected Outcomes
- Complete Testing Workflow YAML file
- Comprehensive agent execution guide
- Clear examples and use cases
- Workflow ready for adoption in other projects
- Coverage and quality validation integrated

### Verification Plan
- Review YAML structure matches Release Workflow pattern
- Verify execution guide follows agent-driven pattern
- Check examples are clear and project-agnostic
- Verify coverage and quality procedures are documented
- Manual review of workflow completeness

## Summary
🚀 Feature: Task 4 complete - Created Testing Workflow example with YAML and execution guide

## Changes

### Added
- Testing Workflow YAML: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/testing-workflow.yaml`
  - 15-step workflow for systematic testing (unit, integration, e2e, performance, regression)
  - 5 phases: Analysis & Planning, Execution, Validation, Documentation & Git Operations, Verification & Results
  - Configurable parameters for test type, approach, and coverage goals
  - Support for multiple test frameworks and approaches (TDD, BDD, ATDD, traditional)
  - Coverage tracking and quality validation
- Testing Workflow Agent Execution Guide: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/testing-workflow-agent-execution.md`
  - Step-by-step execution guide for all 15 steps
  - Agent-driven execution pattern (ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED)
  - Examples for each step
  - Progress tracking with Cursor TODOs
  - Coverage and quality validation procedures

### Notes
- Testing Workflow demonstrates agent-driven execution for testing workflows
- Follows same pattern as Release Workflow (canonical example)
- All examples are project-agnostic and portable
- Workflow includes validation steps (test execution, coverage, linting, type checking, quality validation)
- Coverage tracking ensures test goals are met
- Quality validation ensures tests are well-written and comprehensive
