# Changelog v0.2.4.1+2

**Release Date:** 2025-12-04 10:50:20 UTC
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Workflow Management Framework
**Story:** Story 4 - RW Installer & Plug-and-Play Adoption
**Task:** Task 1 - Analyze RW adoption friction and required config (Workflow hardening guide integration)
**Type:** 📚 Documentation

## PLAN Phase

### Objectives
- Integrate workflow hardening guide philosophy into RW documentation
- Add project-agnostic workflow hardening guide as a first-class standards document
- Link RW execution guide to hardening principles for consistent agent behavior
- Establish clear contract for atomic, predictable RW execution across projects

### Expected Outcomes
- Workflow hardening guide available as reusable standards document
- RW execution guide explicitly references hardening principles
- Clear contract for agents executing RW in this and other projects
- Foundation for consistent RW behavior across multiple repos

### Verification Plan
- Review workflow hardening guide completeness and clarity
- Verify RW execution guide links and summary section are accurate
- Confirm guide is project-agnostic and ready for copy into other repos

## Summary
📚 Documentation: Integrated workflow hardening guide and linked it to RW execution documentation

## Changes

### Added
- **Workflow Hardening Guide:** `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/workflow-hardening-guide.md`
  - Project-agnostic guide for agent-driven release processes
  - Core principles: atomicity, minimal predictable tools, single sources of truth
  - Execution patterns: pre-flight, step discipline, TODO state machine
  - Blocked state contract and tooling rules
  - Consistency checks and integration guidance
  - Ready to copy into other repos (vibe-dev-kit, application repos)

### Updated
- **RW Execution Guide:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
  - Added "🔒 RW Hardening Principles (Summary)" section after overview
  - Summarizes key hardening principles (atomic RW, minimal tools, single sources of truth, TODO state machine, honest blocked states)
  - Explicitly links to workflow hardening guide
  - Establishes RW contract for agents and humans

### Notes
- This release extends T01 analysis work with foundational methodology documentation
- Workflow hardening guide is intentionally project-agnostic for reuse across repos
- RW execution guide now has explicit contract linking to hardening principles
