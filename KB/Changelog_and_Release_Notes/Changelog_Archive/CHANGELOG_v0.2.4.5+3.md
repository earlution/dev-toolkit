## Summary
📚 Documentation: Document lifecycle management spec and policy – TTL-based expiration system for KB documents to prevent bloat while preserving evergreen content

## Changes

### Added
- **Document Lifecycle Metadata Specification:** `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/doc-lifecycle-metadata-spec.md`
  - Complete metadata schema with 5 required fields (`lifecycle`, `ttl_days`, `created_at`, `expires_at`, `housekeeping_policy`)
  - Document type → lifecycle mapping table
  - Agent decision tree for classification
  - Lifecycle transitions (promotion/demotion)
  - Protection rules (reference-based, immutable evidence)
  - Examples for each lifecycle type

- **Document Lifecycle Policy:** `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/doc-lifecycle-policy.md`
  - Policy principles (default to evergreen, explicit lifecycle, reference-aware cleanup)
  - Classification rules for evergreen/timeboxed/transient
  - Housekeeping process (automated workflow, manual cleanup, exceptions)
  - Lifecycle management (promotion/demotion procedures)
  - Agent requirements (creation, updates, lifecycle changes)
  - Enforcement (validation, monitoring)
  - Integration with RW and housekeeping workflows
  - Success criteria

### Notes
- Documents can be classified as `evergreen` (permanent), `timeboxed` (archive after period), or `transient` (delete after period)
- TTL-based expiration enables automated housekeeping
- Reference-aware protection prevents deletion of referenced docs
- Agent-driven management with clear rules for automatic metadata setting
- Foundation for future Doc Housekeeping Workflow package

## Related Tasks
- E2:S04:T05 – Usability test installer on sample and real projects (follow-up: Document lifecycle management)

## Technical Details
- Version moved to `0.2.4.5+3` (Epic 2, Story 4, Task 5, Build 3)
- Metadata spec defines 5 required front-matter fields
- Policy defines 3 lifecycle classes with defaults and housekeeping actions
- Integration points identified for future Doc Housekeeping Workflow
