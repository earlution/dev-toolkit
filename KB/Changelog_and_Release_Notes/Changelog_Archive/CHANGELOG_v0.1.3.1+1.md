## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 1 Completion

- ✅ **KB Structure Analysis Report Created:**
  - Current KB structure fully documented
  - Current structure assessment (strengths and gaps)
  - Target KB structure defined with clear rationale
  - Structure principles documented
  - Migration plan created (4 phases)
  - Recommendations provided

- ✅ **Key Findings:**
  - Current structure is functional but lacks clear organization principles
  - Missing root-level navigation and overview documentation
  - No clear separation between dev-kit governance and framework documentation
  - Changelog archive is well-organized but lacks navigation aids
  - Kanban structure is well-organized and follows best practices

- ✅ **Target Structure Defined:**
  - Root-level KB README for navigation
  - Section-level READMEs for each major area
  - New `Guides/` directory for user-facing documentation
  - Enhanced changelog navigation
  - Clear governance structure
  - Structure documentation

- ✅ **Migration Plan Created:**
  - Phase 1: Add Navigation (Low Risk, 2-4 hours)
  - Phase 2: Create Guides Structure (Low Risk, 1-2 hours)
  - Phase 3: Enhance Governance Structure (Low Risk, 1-2 hours)
  - Phase 4: Update Cross-References (Medium Risk, 2-3 hours)

### Key Sections

**Current Structure Analysis:**
- Complete directory structure documented
- Strengths identified (clear separation, well-organized Kanban, comprehensive changelog)
- Gaps identified (missing navigation, unclear boundaries, no user-facing docs)

**Target Structure:**
- Proposed structure with rationale
- Key improvements documented
- Alignment with dev-kit goals

**Structure Principles:**
- Separation of concerns (Architecture, PM & Portfolio, Changelog, Guides)
- Naming conventions
- Documentation hierarchy

**Migration Plan:**
- 4-phase approach
- Risk assessment for each phase
- Effort estimates
