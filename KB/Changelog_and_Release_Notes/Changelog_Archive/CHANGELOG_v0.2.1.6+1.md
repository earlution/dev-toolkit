## ✅ Completed Work

### E2:S01:T06 – Fix changelog validator ordering bug

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Task created)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ **BR-002 Created:** `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/fr-br/BR-002-changelog-validator-ordering-bug.md`
  - Complete bug report with description, steps to reproduce, impact assessment
  - Acceptance criteria for fix
  - Fix attempt history section (ready for future attempts)
- ✅ **Task Added to Story 1:** E2:S01:T06 added to Story 1 task checklist
  - Task definition with approach, acceptance criteria, and files to update
  - Story status changed from COMPLETE to IN PROGRESS
- ✅ **Epic/Story Updated:** Updated Epic 2 and Story 1 documents with version markers

**Key Decisions Made:**
- **Bug Classification:** Validator expects canonical ordering (lowest first) but Keep a Changelog format uses newest first
- **Fix Approach:** Support both formats with configuration option, default to Keep a Changelog format (industry standard)
- **Task Assignment:** Added to Epic 2 Story 1 (RW Agent Execution & Docs) since validators are part of RW

**Problem Statement:**
The `validate_changelog_format.py` validator incorrectly expects canonical ordering (lowest version first) when it should respect Keep a Changelog format (newest first). This causes false positives when validating changelogs that correctly follow Keep a Changelog conventions. The `been-there` project identified this issue when syncing the workflow management framework.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement fix to support both Keep a Changelog format (newest first) and canonical ordering (lowest first)
- Add configuration option to choose format preference
- Update documentation explaining both formats
- Add test cases for both formats

## 📝 Notes

This release creates the bug report and Kanban task for fixing the changelog validator ordering bug. The validator currently expects canonical ordering (lowest version first) but Keep a Changelog format uses newest first. The fix will support both formats with a configuration option, defaulting to Keep a Changelog format (industry standard).

The bug was identified by the `been-there` project when syncing the workflow management framework from v2.0.0 to v2.1.0. The validator reported an ordering issue for correctly formatted Keep a Changelog entries.
