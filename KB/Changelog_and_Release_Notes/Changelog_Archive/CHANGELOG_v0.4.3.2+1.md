# Release v0.4.3.2+1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-02 00:00:00 UTC

**Epic / Story / Task:** Epic 4, Story 3, Task 2  
**Type:** 📚 Documentation

---

## 📋 Summary

This release completes **Task 2: Validate Kanban → Versioning integration in dev-kit**. A comprehensive validation report has been created, identifying a **critical inconsistency** in how Task numbers map to version `TASK` components. The validation reveals that all Tasks within a Story are using `TASK=1`, with `BUILD` incrementing across Tasks, which violates the versioning schema rules.

---

## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 2 Completion

- ✅ **Kanban → Versioning Integration Validation Completed:**
  - Validated Epic/Story number mapping to version components
  - Validated Task number mapping to version `TASK` component
  - Validated version assignment at Task creation
  - Validated version file updates alignment with Kanban Task creation
  - Documented gaps and inconsistencies

- ✅ **Validation Report Created** (`T002-kanban-versioning-validation.md`):
  - Validation methodology and test cases
  - Epic/Story mapping validation (✅ PASS)
  - Task mapping validation (❌ FAIL - critical issue identified)
  - Version assignment validation (⚠️ PARTIAL)
  - Version file updates validation (⚠️ PARTIAL)
  - Root cause analysis
  - Recommendations for fixes

### Critical Finding

**Task Number Mapping Issue:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL:** Task numbers are NOT correctly mapping to version `TASK` component
- All Tasks within a Story are using `TASK=1`, with `BUILD` incrementing across Tasks
- This violates versioning schema rules and breaks forensic traceability

**Evidence:**
- E4:S01:T001 → `v0.4.1.1+2` ❌ (should be `v0.4.1.1+1`)
- E4:S01:T002 → `v0.4.1.1+3` ❌ (should be `v0.4.1.2+1`)
- E2:S01:T001 → `v0.2.1.1+3` ❌ (should be `v0.2.1.1+1`)
- E2:S01:T002 → `v0.2.1.1+4` ❌ (should be `v0.2.1.2+1`)

**Root Cause:**
- `VERSION_TASK` is not automatically updated when moving to a new Task
- `VERSION_BUILD` increments across Tasks instead of resetting to 1
- Manual update required but not consistently done

### Validation Results

**✅ Epic/Story Mapping:**
- Epic and Story numbers correctly map to version `EPIC` and `STORY` components
- Examples: Epic 4, Story 1 → `v0.4.1.x+x` ✅

**❌ Task Mapping:**
- Task numbers are NOT correctly mapping to version `TASK` component
- All Tasks in a Story use `TASK=1`, with `BUILD` incrementing (2, 3, 4, 5, 6...)
- Violates versioning schema: each new Task should increment `TASK` and reset `BUILD` to 1

**⚠️ Version Assignment:**
- Version assignment happens at Task creation, but uses incorrect TASK number
- `VERSION_TASK` from `version.py` is not updated when moving to a new Task

**⚠️ Version File Updates:**
- Version file updates align with Kanban Task creation, but reflect incorrect mapping
- `VERSION_TASK` stays at 1, and `VERSION_BUILD` increments instead

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fixes:**
   - Update version assignment process to update `VERSION_TASK` when creating new Tasks
   - Add validation to ensure `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task number
   - Update intake guides to include TASK update step

2. **Process Improvements:**
   - Automate TASK updates when RW detects a new Task
   - Enhance intake guides with explicit TASK update step
   - Update documentation to emphasize TASK updates

3. **Long-Term Solutions:**
   - Consider automatic version file updates during Task creation
   - Add version validation to RW Step 1 (Branch Safety Check)
   - Create tooling to automatically update `VERSION_TASK`

### Key Documentation

**Validation Report Sections:**
1. Validation Methodology
2. Validation Results (Epic/Story mapping, Task mapping, version assignment, version file updates)
3. Root Cause Analysis
4. Gaps and Inconsistencies
5. Recommendations (immediate fixes, process improvements, long-term solutions)
6. Correct Version Progression Examples

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- **Critical Issue Identified:** Task numbers are not correctly mapping to version `TASK` component. This is a systemic issue affecting all Stories in the dev-kit.
- **Root Cause:** Manual `VERSION_TASK` updates are required but not consistently done. The RW increments `BUILD` but doesn't update `TASK` when moving to a new Task.
- **Impact:** Version numbers don't reflect actual Task progression, breaking forensic traceability. Multiple Tasks share the same TASK number, making it impossible to distinguish between Tasks using version numbers alone.
- **Solution Path:** Need to update version assignment process, add validation, and potentially automate TASK updates.
