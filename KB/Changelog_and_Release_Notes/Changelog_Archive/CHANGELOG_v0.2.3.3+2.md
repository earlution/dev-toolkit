# Changelog v0.2.3.3+2

**Release Date:** 2025-12-03 17:18:58 UTC
**Epic:** Epic 2 - Workflow Management Framework
**Story:** Story 3 - Additional Workflows & Examples
**Task:** Task 3 - Create Migration Workflow example
**Type:** 🔧 Improvement

## PLAN Phase

### Objectives
- Strengthen RW Step 2 (Bump Version) procedure to prevent BUILD-increment anti-pattern
- Create versioning error reference guide for future error prevention
- Make Story file read mandatory in RW Step 2
- Add explicit validation steps before and after version updates
- Document lessons learned from versioning error in other project

### Expected Outcomes
- Explicit 6-step procedure (A-F) in RW Step 2 that cannot be skipped
- Mandatory Story file read to identify completed task
- Mandatory task number comparison logic
- Validation gates before and after updating version file
- Error reference guide for future prevention
- Enhanced RW documentation with explicit procedures

### Verification Plan
- Review RW Step 2 procedure in cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md
- Verify explicit 6-step procedure (A-F) is present
- Check release-workflow-agent-execution.md Step 2 matches procedure
- Verify versioning-error-reference-guide.md is complete
- Manual review of procedure clarity and completeness

## Summary
🔧 Improvement: Strengthened RW Step 2 (Bump Version) with explicit mandatory procedure to prevent BUILD-increment anti-pattern. Created versioning error reference guide based on lessons learned from other project.

## Changes

### Added
- Versioning Error Reference Guide: `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/versioning-error-reference-guide.md`
  - Comprehensive reference for BUILD-increment anti-pattern
  - Root cause analysis
  - Step-by-step fix documentation
  - Prevention measures and key takeaways
  - Usage guide for future error handling

### Changed
- RW Step 2 in `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md`
  - Replaced vague instruction with explicit 6-step procedure (A-F)
  - Added mandatory Story file read (Step B)
  - Added mandatory task number extraction (Step B)
  - Added mandatory comparison logic (Step C) with error handling
  - Added validation before updating (Step D)
  - Added validation after updating (Step F)
  - Added critical requirements section with MUST statements
  - Updated TODO description to include all required steps
- RW Step 2 in `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
  - Restructured to follow explicit 6-step procedure (A-F)
  - Made Story file read mandatory and explicit
  - Enhanced validation steps before and after updating
  - Added error handling for invalid cases
  - Enhanced documentation requirements
  - Added critical reminders section

### Notes
- This improvement prevents the versioning error where BUILD is incremented instead of TASK when completing new tasks
- The explicit procedure forces agents to read Story file and compare task numbers before updating version
- Validation gates catch errors before they propagate
- Error reference guide serves as comprehensive documentation for future error prevention
- All changes follow the strengthened RW model based on lessons learned

## Related Tasks
- E2:S03:T03 – Create Migration Workflow example ✅ COMPLETE (continuation/improvement)

## Technical Details
- Explicit 6-step procedure: A. Read Current Version, B. Identify Completed Task (MANDATORY), C. Determine Version Bump (MANDATORY LOGIC), D. Validate Before Updating, E. Update Version File, F. Validate After Updating
- Mandatory Story file read prevents assumption of same task
- Task number comparison logic with error handling
- Validation gates before and after version update
- Error reference guide includes root cause analysis, fix documentation, and prevention measures
