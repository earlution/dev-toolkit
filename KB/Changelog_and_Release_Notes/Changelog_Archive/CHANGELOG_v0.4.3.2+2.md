  - Identified 4 primary root causes
  - Documented 6 contributing factors
  - Identified 8 documentation gaps
  - Created comprehensive root cause analysis document

- ✅ **Documentation Updates (8 Files):**
  - Release Workflow Step 1: Added Task/version alignment validation
  - Release Workflow Step 2: Added Task transition detection and automatic updates
  - Versioning Policy: Added explicit Task transition rules and examples
  - FR/BR Intake Guide: Added mandatory version.py update requirements

### Release Workflow Enhancements

**Step 1: Branch Safety Check**
- ✅ Added Task/Version alignment validation
- ✅ Validates that `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task number from Story document
- ✅ Stops workflow if mismatch detected with clear error message
- ✅ Added example Task alignment checks

**Step 2: Bump Version**
- ✅ Added Task transition detection
- ✅ Automatically detects when moving to a new Task
- ✅ Updates `VERSION_TASK` to match active Task number if transition detected
- ✅ Resets `VERSION_BUILD` to 1 for new Tasks
- ✅ Increments `VERSION_BUILD` only for same Task
- ✅ Validates updates after execution

### Versioning Policy Updates

- ✅ Added "Task Transitions" section (Section 6.1)
- ✅ Explicit rules for updating `VERSION_TASK` when moving to new Tasks
- ✅ Explicit rules for resetting `VERSION_BUILD` to 1 for new Tasks
- ✅ When to update: Option 1 (at Task creation) or Option 2 (during RW Step 2)
- ✅ Validation requirements
- ✅ Example showing Task transition (before/after)
- ✅ Common mistakes to avoid with examples

### Intake Process Updates

**FR/BR Intake Guide:**
- ✅ Enhanced "Assign Version Number" section with CRITICAL markers
- ✅ Explicit validation requirement
- ✅ Example showing correct version file update
- ✅ Note about RW validation and automatic detection

**FR/BR Intake Agent Guide:**
- ✅ Added "CRITICAL: Update Version File" subsection
- ✅ Mandatory requirement to update `version.py`
- ✅ Explicit steps for updating `VERSION_TASK` and `VERSION_BUILD`
- ✅ Example showing correct update
- ✅ Explanation of why this matters (RW validation)

### Kanban Governance Updates

- ✅ Enhanced "Task-Level Requirements" section
- ✅ Added "CRITICAL: Task Transitions and Version File Updates" subsection
- ✅ Explicit rules for updating `version.py` when creating new Tasks
- ✅ Explicit rules for RW Step 1 and Step 2 handling of Task transitions
- ✅ Added "Common Mistakes to Avoid" with examples

### Analysis Documents Created

- ✅ **Root Cause Analysis** (`T002-root-cause-analysis.md`):
  - Comprehensive analysis of why the issue occurred
  - 4 primary root causes identified
  - 6 contributing factors documented
  - 8 documentation gaps identified
  - Prevention strategy outlined

- ✅ **Documentation Updates Summary** (`T002-documentation-updates-summary.md`):
  - Summary of all 8 documentation updates
  - Impact assessment for each update
  - Testing recommendations
  - Prevention strategy

## 💡 Key Findings / Learnings

- **Root Cause:** Release Workflow Step 2 didn't detect Task transitions and update `VERSION_TASK` accordingly. Manual updates were required but not consistently performed.
- **Contributing Factors:** Manual process dependency, BUILD increments masking the issue, no clear "start new Task" workflow, version file update timing ambiguity, lack of examples, no pre-RW validation checklist.
- **Solution:** Added explicit Task transition detection in RW Step 2, validation in RW Step 1, mandatory version file updates in intake process, and comprehensive documentation updates.
- **Prevention:** Multiple layers of protection: RW Step 1 validation, RW Step 2 automatic detection, explicit documentation requirements, examples showing correct behavior.
