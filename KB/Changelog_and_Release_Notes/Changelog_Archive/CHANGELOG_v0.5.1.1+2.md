## Changes

### 📋 Task Planning

**Documentation Hygiene Analysis Task (E5:S01:T01):**
- Added comprehensive task definition for documentation hygiene analysis
- Task includes 6-step approach:
  1. Inventory documentation corpus
  2. Analyze documentation issues (broken links, outdated info, inconsistencies, orphaned files, version mismatches, missing docs, format issues, documentation drift)
  3. Categorize issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  4. Analyze documentation patterns and anti-patterns
  5. Create comprehensive hygiene report
  6. Provide actionable recommendations
- Task deliverables include:
  - Documentation hygiene analysis report
  - Detailed issues inventory
  - Health metrics and scoring
  - Prioritized recommendations

**Task Restructuring:**
- Renumbered tasks: T01 → Hygiene Analysis, T02 → Define Policies, T03 → Review Cadences, T04 → Update Triggers
- Updated dependencies: T02 now depends on T01, T03 depends on T02, T04 depends on T02
- Updated Epic-5.md task list to reflect new structure
