## Key Edge Cases Documented

### Critical Anti-Patterns
1. **BUILD Incremented Instead of TASK** – Most common mistake, now with mandatory prevention steps
2. **Standalone Task References** – Always use full `Exx:Sxx:Txx` format
3. **Version Mismatch** – Commit message and tag must match version file

### Structural Edge Cases
4. **Task Renumbering** – How to handle when tasks are renumbered after releases
5. **Story Re-Parenting** – How to handle when stories move between epics
6. **Version Conflicts** – How to handle parallel development on same epic/story/task

### Operational Edge Cases
7. **Incorrect TASK Mapping** – Version file doesn't match active task
8. **BUILD Number Overflow** – Tasks with too many builds
9. **Missing Version in Changelog** – Changelog entries without version numbers
10. **Parallel Epic Ordering** – Understanding canonical vs chronological ordering
