## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 1 Completion

- ✅ Created **gap analysis report** (`T001-gap-analysis-report.md`)
  - Compared framework Kanban governance policy with dev-kit policy
  - Compared framework templates (Epic, Story) with dev-kit usage
  - Identified 7 critical gaps:
    1. Atomic RW behaviour (not documented)
    2. "ALL sections" update requirement (not documented)
    3. Accessibility constraints (not documented)
    4. Forensic marker format standardization (incomplete)
    5. Consistency requirements (incomplete)
    6. Review schedules (not documented)
    7. Escalation procedures (not documented)
  - Identified template gaps (missing update requirement notes, consistency reminders)
  - Identified dev-kit policy gaps (missing framework principles)
  - Provided prioritized recommendations

- ✅ Updated **Story 001** (`Story-001-dev-kit-kanban-implementation.md`)
  - Marked Task 1 as complete in task checklist
  - Updated task details with completion status and findings summary

### Key Findings

**Critical Gaps:**
- ⚠️ **Atomic RW behaviour** - Neither policy explicitly documents that RW must complete all steps or stop with explicit BLOCKED message
- ⚠️ **"ALL sections" update requirement** - Neither policy explicitly documents that Epic docs must update header, Story Checklist, AND detailed story sections
- ⚠️ **Accessibility constraints** - Neither policy explicitly documents no partial updates, no silent failures, clear actionable messages
- ⚠️ **Forensic marker format** - Format shown in examples but not explicitly standardized
- ⚠️ **Consistency requirements** - Mentioned but not detailed
- ⚠️ **Review schedules** - Not documented
- ⚠️ **Escalation procedures** - Not documented

**Template Gaps:**
- Missing "ALL sections" update requirement notes
- Missing forensic marker format standardization notes
- Missing consistency check reminders

**Dev-Kit Policy Gaps:**
- Missing framework principles (Harmonious Cycle, detailed FR/BR flow, Task-Level Requirements, Release Workflow documentation)
