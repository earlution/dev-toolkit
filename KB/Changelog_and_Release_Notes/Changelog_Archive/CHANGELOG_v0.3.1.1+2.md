---

## 🎯 What's Changed

### Task 1 Completion

- ✅ Created **gap analysis report** (`KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-3/stories/Story-001-dev-kit-alignment-with-versioning-framework/T001-gap-analysis-report.md`)
  - Compared dev-kit policy with framework policies
  - Identified 6 critical gaps (missing sections)
  - Documented alignment strengths
  - Provided prioritized recommendations

- ✅ Updated **Story 001** (`Story-001-dev-kit-alignment-with-versioning-framework.md`)
  - Marked Task 1 as complete in task checklist
  - Updated task details with completion status and findings summary
  - Added reference to gap analysis report in References section

### Key Findings

**Alignment Assessment: GOOD** ✅

**Strengths:**
- Schema definition matches perfectly
- Progression rules are correct
- Relationship to framework is clear
- No legacy complexity (clean Epic 1+ start)

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. ❌ CHANGELOG Format - Not documented in dev-kit policy
2. ❌ Canonical Ordering Principle - Not documented
3. ❌ Two-Layer Timestamp System - Not documented
4. ❌ Forensic Traceability Grid - Not documented
5. ❌ Immutability Rules - Not documented
6. ❌ Version Validation - Not documented

**Minor Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Version file location uses legacy path (`src/fynd_deals/version.py`)

**Recommendations:**
- High Priority: Add 6 missing sections to dev-kit policy
- Medium Priority: Update version file location to dev-kit-specific path

## 📝 Notes

The gap analysis provides a clear roadmap for enhancing the dev-kit versioning policy to match the framework's comprehensiveness while maintaining its clean, project-specific approach. The framework policies serve as the canonical source of truth, and the dev-kit policy should reference and align with them.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **T003:** Update dev-kit versioning policy as canonical SoT (using gap analysis findings)
- **T004:** Align dev-kit version.py and CHANGELOG with framework (update file location)
- **T005:** Document consumption pattern for other projects
