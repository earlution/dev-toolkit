# Task 002 – Add ACT Phase (Step 13: Act on Verification Results)

**Task:** E2:S02:T002  
**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Created:** 2025-12-03  
**Story:** Story 002 – PDCA Integration into Release Workflow

---

## Overview

Add Step 13 (Act on Verification Results) to the Release Workflow to implement the ACT phase of the PDCA cycle. This step enables updating changelogs based on verification results, standardizing successful practices, and creating follow-up tasks when needed.

---

## Input

- Step 12 (CHECK phase) implementation from T01
- PDCA integration plan: `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/rw-pdca-integration-plan.md`
- Current changelog format

---

## Deliverable

- Step 13 added to RW workflow YAML
- Step 13 execution guide in RW agent execution documentation
- Action workflow template
- Changelog update mechanism for verified fixes
- Process improvement documentation
- Examples of action workflows

---

## Approach

1. **Update Workflow YAML:**
   - Add Step 13 to `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/release-workflow.yaml`
   - Configure dependencies (depends on Step 12)
   - Set as optional but enabled by default

2. **Add Step 13 Execution Guide:**
   - Add Step 13 section to `release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
   - Follow ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern
   - Include action workflow for verified fixes
   - Include action workflow for failed fixes
   - Include action workflow for deferred verification

3. **Create Action Workflow Template:**
   - Template for verified fix actions (update changelog)
   - Template for failed fix actions (document, create follow-up)
   - Template for deferred verification (document plan, schedule)

4. **Add Changelog Update Mechanism:**
   - Process for moving "Attempted Fix" to "Fixed"
   - Process for documenting failed fixes
   - Process for documenting deferred verification

5. **Add Process Improvement Documentation:**
   - Template for capturing lessons learned
   - Template for process improvement tracking
   - Integration with RW documentation updates

6. **Add Examples:**
   - Example of verified fix action workflow
   - Example of failed fix action workflow
   - Example of deferred verification action workflow
