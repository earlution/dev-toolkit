# Task 001 – Add CHECK Phase (Step 12: Post-Commit Verification & Reflection)

**Task:** E2:S02:T001  
**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Created:** 2025-12-03  
**Story:** Story 002 – PDCA Integration into Release Workflow

---

## Overview

Add Step 12 (Post-Commit Verification & Reflection) to the Release Workflow to implement the CHECK phase of the PDCA cycle. This step enables explicit verification of changes after commit and structured reflection on results.

---

## Input

- Current RW workflow (11 steps)
- PDCA integration plan: `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/rw-pdca-integration-plan.md`
- Fix verification requirements: `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (lines 101-150)

---

## Deliverable

- Step 12 added to RW workflow YAML
- Step 12 execution guide in RW agent execution documentation
- Verification workflow template
- Reflection questions template
- Updated RW execution guide with Step 12
- Examples of verification documentation

---

## Approach

1. **Update Workflow YAML:**
   - Add Step 12 to `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/workflows/release-workflow.yaml`
   - Configure dependencies (depends on Step 11)
   - Set as optional but enabled by default

2. **Add Step 12 Execution Guide:**
   - Add Step 12 section to `release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
   - Follow ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern
   - Include verification prompt workflow
   - Include reflection questions

3. **Create Verification Workflow Template:**
   - Template for verification process
   - Verification methods (test suite, manual testing, observation)
   - Verification documentation format

4. **Create Reflection Questions Template:**
   - Standard reflection questions
   - Evaluation criteria
   - Learning capture format

5. **Add Examples:**
   - Example of verified fix workflow
   - Example of unverified fix workflow
   - Example of deferred verification workflow

6. **Update Validators:**
   - Add support for verification status in changelog
   - Validate verification evidence when present

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Step 12 added to `release-workflow.yaml`
- [ ] Step 12 execution guide added to `release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- [ ] Verification workflow template created
- [ ] Reflection questions template created
- [ ] Examples added to documentation
- [ ] Validators updated to support verification status
- [ ] Step 12 follows ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern
- [ ] Step 12 integrates with existing fix verification requirements
