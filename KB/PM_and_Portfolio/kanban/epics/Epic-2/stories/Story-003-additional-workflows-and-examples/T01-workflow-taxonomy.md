# Workflow Taxonomy

**Task:** E2:S03:T01 – Analyze workflow types and create workflow taxonomy

**Created:** 2025-12-03  
**Story:** Story 3 - Additional Workflows & Examples

---

## Overview

This document defines a taxonomy of workflow types that can be implemented using the agent-driven workflow execution pattern. The taxonomy categorizes workflows by purpose, complexity, and common use cases.

---

## Workflow Categories

### 1. Code Quality Workflows

- **Linting Workflow:** Code style and quality checks
- **Documentation Workflow:** Code documentation generation and updates

**Common Steps:**
1. Analyze current state
2. Plan changes
3. Execute refactoring/documentation
4. Validate changes
5. Update documentation

---

### 2. Migration Workflows

**Purpose:** Migrate code, data, or infrastructure

**Examples:**
- **Database Migration Workflow:** Database schema migrations
- **Dependency Migration Workflow:** Upgrading dependencies
- **Framework Migration Workflow:** Migrating between frameworks
- **Infrastructure Migration Workflow:** Cloud or infrastructure changes

**Common Steps:**
1. Analyze source and target states
2. Plan migration strategy
3. Execute migration steps
4. Validate migration
5. Rollback plan (if needed)

---

### 3. Testing Workflows

**Purpose:** Execute and manage testing processes

**Examples:**
- **Test Suite Workflow:** Run and manage test suites
- **Integration Test Workflow:** Integration testing process
- **Performance Test Workflow:** Performance testing
- **Security Test Workflow:** Security testing

**Common Steps:**
1. Analyze test requirements
2. Prepare test environment
3. Execute tests
4. Validate results
5. Report findings

---

### 4. Deployment Workflows

**Purpose:** Deploy applications and services

**Examples:**
- **Application Deployment Workflow:** Deploy application to production
- **Infrastructure Deployment Workflow:** Deploy infrastructure changes
- **Rollback Workflow:** Rollback deployments
- **Blue-Green Deployment Workflow:** Blue-green deployment pattern

**Common Steps:**
1. Analyze deployment requirements
2. Prepare deployment environment
3. Execute deployment
4. Validate deployment
5. Monitor and verify

---

### 5. Maintenance Workflows

**Purpose:** Regular maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
- **Dependency Update Workflow:** Update project dependencies
- **Security Patch Workflow:** Apply security patches
- **Cleanup Workflow:** Clean up unused code/resources
- **Archive Workflow:** Archive old code/data

**Common Steps:**
1. Analyze maintenance needs
2. Plan maintenance tasks
3. Execute maintenance
4. Validate results
5. Document changes

---

## Workflow Pattern Analysis

### Common Pattern Elements

All workflows following the agent-driven execution pattern share:

1. **ANALYZE Phase:**
   - Understand current state
   - Identify requirements
   - Assess constraints

2. **DETERMINE Phase:**
   - Decide on approach
   - Plan steps
   - Identify dependencies

3. **EXECUTE Phase:**
   - Perform actions
   - Make changes
   - Update state

4. **VALIDATE Phase:**
   - Verify results
   - Check outcomes
   - Validate changes

5. **PROCEED Phase:**
   - Document results
   - Move to next step
   - Complete workflow

---

## Workflow Complexity Levels

### Simple Workflows (3-5 steps)

**Characteristics:**
- Single purpose
- Linear execution
- Minimal dependencies
- Quick execution

**Examples:**
- Linting Workflow
- Documentation Generation Workflow
- Simple Test Workflow

---

### Medium Workflows (6-10 steps)

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple phases
- Some parallel execution
- Moderate dependencies
- Medium execution time

**Examples:**
- Refactor Workflow
- Migration Workflow
- Integration Test Workflow

---

### Complex Workflows (11+ steps)

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple phases
- Complex dependencies
- Parallel and sequential steps
- Long execution time

**Examples:**
- Release Workflow (13 steps)
- Full Deployment Workflow
- Complete Migration Workflow

---

## Use Case Analysis

### Use Case 1: Code Refactoring

**Scenario:** Refactor a module to improve structure and maintainability

**Workflow Type:** Code Quality - Refactor Workflow

**Steps:**
1. Analyze current code structure
2. Plan refactoring approach
3. Create refactoring branch
4. Execute refactoring
5. Run tests
6. Update documentation
7. Create pull request
8. Review and merge

---

### Use Case 2: Dependency Upgrade

**Scenario:** Upgrade a major dependency version

**Workflow Type:** Migration - Dependency Migration Workflow

**Steps:**
1. Analyze current dependency
2. Review breaking changes
3. Plan upgrade strategy
4. Update dependency
5. Fix breaking changes
6. Run test suite
7. Update documentation
8. Deploy changes

---

### Use Case 3: Test Suite Execution

**Scenario:** Run comprehensive test suite before release

**Workflow Type:** Testing - Test Suite Workflow

**Steps:**
1. Analyze test requirements
2. Prepare test environment
3. Run unit tests
4. Run integration tests
5. Run e2e tests
6. Validate results
7. Generate test report
8. Document results

---

## Workflow Selection Criteria

### When to Use Each Workflow Type

**Code Quality Workflows:**
- Improving code structure
- Maintaining code standards
- Updating documentation

**Migration Workflows:**
- Moving between versions
- Changing frameworks
- Upgrading infrastructure

**Testing Workflows:**
- Validating changes
- Ensuring quality
- Regression testing

**Deployment Workflows:**
- Releasing to production
- Infrastructure changes
- Service updates

**Maintenance Workflows:**

- Security patches
- Cleanup tasks

---

## Workflow Template Structure

### Standard Workflow Template

```yaml
name: [Workflow Name]
version: 1.0.0
type: [workflow_type]
description: [Description]

config:
  # Workflow-level configuration

steps:
  - id: step-1
    name: [Step Name]
    type: [step_type]
    handler: [handler_function]
    required: true
    dependencies: []
    config:
      # Step-specific configuration

parameters:
  - name: [parameter_name]
    type: [parameter_type]
    required: true
    description: [Description]
```

## Integration with Agent-Driven Execution

All workflows in this taxonomy follow the agent-driven execution pattern:

1. **Agent analyzes** each step before executing
2. **Agent determines** appropriate actions
3. **Agent executes** actions intelligently
4. **Agent validates** results
5. **Agent documents** and proceeds

This ensures workflows adapt to project context and handle edge cases intelligently.

---

## Next Steps

Based on this taxonomy, the following workflow examples will be created:

1. **Refactor Workflow** (Code Quality)
2. **Migration Workflow** (Migration)
3. **Testing Workflow** (Testing)

Each will include:
- Complete YAML definition
- Agent execution guide
- Examples and use cases
- Customization guidance
