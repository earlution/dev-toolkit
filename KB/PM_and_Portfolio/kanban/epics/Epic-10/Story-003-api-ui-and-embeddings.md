# Epic 10, Story 3: API, UI, and Embeddings Design

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-11 (v0.10.3.3+1 – Task 3 complete: UI framework selection)  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Actual Effort:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.10.3.3+1  
**Code:** E10S03

---

## Task Checklist

- [ ] **E10:S03:T01 – REST/GraphQL API design (submission, search/retrieval)**  
- [ ] **E10:S03:T02 – Embeddings endpoint design (semantic retrieval for agents)**  
- [x] **E10:S03:T03 – UI flows (search/browse/detail/submission, filters, provenance/licensing display)** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.10.3.3+1)  
- [ ] **E10:S03:T04 – Request/response contracts and examples**  
- [ ] **E10:S03:T05 – Rate limiting, auth, and privacy considerations**

---

## Goal

Define the API surface (REST/GraphQL + embeddings) and UI flows for the Problem-Solution KB platform, ensuring provenance/license visibility and agent-friendly semantics.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] REST/GraphQL endpoints defined with request/response schemas
- [ ] Embeddings endpoint defined (inputs, outputs, vector store assumptions)
- [ ] UI flows documented (search/browse/detail/submission) with filters and provenance display
- [ ] Example payloads for submission and search (including semantic use cases)
- [ ] Non-functional concerns captured (rate limits, auth, privacy)
- [ ] Ready for implementation planning (MVP)
