## Overview

This story creates **framework-level integration documentation** that explains how the Numbering & Versioning framework integrates with the Kanban and Workflow Management frameworks. Unlike E4:S03 (which validated dev-kit implementation), this story focuses on **portable, template-ready documentation** that external projects can use to integrate all three frameworks.

---

## Goal

Provide comprehensive, framework-level integration documentation that:
- Explains how the three frameworks work together at the framework level
- Provides portable patterns and examples for external projects
- Documents integration best practices and common patterns
- Includes troubleshooting guides and edge case handling
- Is distinct from dev-kit-specific implementation validation (E4:S03)

- `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md`
- `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dev-kit-kanban-versioning-rw-integration.md` (dev-kit specific)

## Notes

**Distinction from E4:S03:**
- **E4:S03:** Validated integration in dev-kit implementation (dev-kit specific paths, examples, validation)
- **E3:S03:** Framework-level integration documentation (portable, template-ready, external project focused)

**Scope:**
- Framework-level patterns and practices
- Portable documentation for external projects
- Integration architecture and data flow
- Best practices and anti-patterns
- Troubleshooting and edge cases
