# Story 001 – Dev Kit Alignment with Versioning Framework

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]
**Created:** 2025-12-02
**Last updated:** 2025-12-02 (v0.3.1.6+1 – Task 6 complete: Cursorrules abstracted (removed hardcoded version numbers))
**Version:** v0.3.1.6+1
**Code:** E3S01

---

## Overview

Ensure the dev kit's own versioning policy, version file, and docs align cleanly with the generic versioning framework. This story ensures that `vibe-dev-kit` serves as the **single point of truth (SoT)** for versioning policies and strategies, which other projects can copy and adapt.

---

## Goal

Make sure the dev kit's versioning implementation demonstrates best practices and serves as the canonical reference for how to adopt the `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` schema in new projects.

### E3:S01:T003 – Update dev-kit versioning policy as canonical SoT ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Findings from T001 and T002  
**Deliverable:** Updated canonical versioning policy ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** E3:S01:T001, E3:S01:T002  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Dev-kit versioning policy updated with all missing sections

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Enhanced `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md` with:
   - CHANGELOG Format section (two-layer system)
   - Canonical Ordering Principle section
   - Two-Layer Timestamp System section
   - Forensic Traceability Grid section (5 dimensions)
   - Immutability Rules section (3 rules)
   - Version Validation section
   - Enhanced Relationship to Framework Policies section
   - Status and Maintenance section
   - Comprehensive References section

2. ✅ Documented relationship between framework policy (SoT) and dev-kit adaptations
3. ✅ Updated policy status from "Draft" to "Active"

**Key Sections Added:**
- ✅ CHANGELOG Format (Section 7) - Two-layer system documented
- ✅ Canonical Ordering Principle (Section 8) - Version numbers are canonical
- ✅ Two-Layer Timestamp System (Section 9) - Main vs detailed changelog timestamps
- ✅ Forensic Traceability Grid (Section 10) - 5 dimensions documented
- ✅ Immutability Rules (Section 11) - 3 rules documented
- ✅ Version Validation (Section 12) - Validation scripts and behavior documented

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md` - Enhanced with all missing sections
- ✅ Policy status updated to "Active"

**Note:** Framework policies (`packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/`) remain the canonical SoT. Dev-kit policy now comprehensively documents how the framework is applied in dev-kit context, referencing framework for detailed explanations.

### E3:S01:T005 – Document consumption pattern for other projects ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Updated policies and version file from T003-T004  
**Deliverable:** Consumption documentation ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** E3:S01:T003, E3:S01:T004  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Consumption pattern documented in README and IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Enhanced `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/README.md`:
   - Added comprehensive "Consumption Pattern for Other Projects" section
   - Documented copy vs reference pattern (CRITICAL: copy, don't reference)
   - Explained customization boundaries (what can be customized vs what must stay)
   - Documented update process (how to stay aligned with framework updates)
   - Added example setup workflow
   - Clarified SoT relationship (vibe-dev-kit is canonical source)

2. ✅ Enhanced `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`:
   - Added "CRITICAL: Copy, Don't Reference" section at top
   - Added comprehensive "Consumption Pattern for Other Projects" section
   - Documented copy vs reference pattern with examples
   - Explained why copying is required (independence, customization, control, stability)
   - Documented customization process step-by-step
   - Added example complete setup workflow
   - Clarified framework as single source of truth

**Key Documentation Points:**
- ✅ **Copy, don't reference:** Projects must copy files, not link to `vibe-dev-kit`
- ✅ **Customization boundaries:** What can be customized (Epic ranges, paths) vs what must stay (schema, validation)
- ✅ **Update process:** How to pull framework updates into projects (monitor, review, selectively adopt)
- ✅ **SoT relationship:** `vibe-dev-kit` is the canonical source, projects adapt for their context

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/README.md` - Added consumption section

### E3:S01:T006 – Make .cursorrules abstract (remove hardcoded version numbers) ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Findings from T002 (versioning pattern analysis)  
**Deliverable:** Updated `.cursorrules` template without hardcoded versions ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** E3:S01:T002  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Cursorrules RW trigger section abstracted with template placeholders

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Analyzed `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md`
2. ✅ Identified hardcoded version numbers and project-specific paths:
   - Hardcoded paths: `src/fynd_deals/version.py`, `knowledge/fynd_deals/Kanban/`
   - Hardcoded examples: `0.15.1.4+2`, `epic/15`, `epic/10-fastapi-migration`
3. ✅ Replaced with abstract templates:
   - File paths: `src/{project}/version.py`, `{kanban_path}/epics/Epic-{epic}.md`
   - Generic examples: `0.{epic}.{story}.{task}+{build}`, `epic/{n}`
   - Schema calculation examples showing pattern (Epic N → `0.N.S.T+1`)
4. ✅ Added version calculation examples section
5. ✅ Added reference documentation section pointing to canonical policies
6. ✅ Updated README.md with abstracted examples

**Problem Solved:**
- ✅ Hardcoded version numbers removed (replaced with schema calculation examples)
- ✅ Project-specific paths replaced with template placeholders
- ✅ Examples now teach the pattern rather than listing stale instances
- ✅ References canonical policy documents instead of duplicating schema

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/cursorrules-rw-trigger-section.md` - Abstracted all hardcoded references
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/README.md` - Updated with abstracted examples

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ File paths use template placeholders (`{project}`, `{kanban_path}`, `{scripts_path}`)
- ✅ Version examples use generic schema calculation (`0.{epic}.{story}.{task}+{build}`)
- ✅ Branch examples use generic patterns (`epic/{n}`, `epic/{n}-{description}`)
- ✅ Added version calculation examples showing pattern (Epic N → `0.N.S.T+1`)
- ✅ References canonical policy documents (`KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md`)
- ✅ Added customization instructions for projects copying the template

**Validation:**
- ✅ No project-specific version numbers remain (verified with grep)
- ✅ Examples are generic and teach the pattern
- ✅ Schema explanations reference canonical policy documents
- ✅ File remains useful without requiring updates as work progresses
