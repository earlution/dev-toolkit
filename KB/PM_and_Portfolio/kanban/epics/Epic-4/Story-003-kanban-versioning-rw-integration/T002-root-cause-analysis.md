# Root Cause Analysis: Task → Version TASK Component Mapping Failure

**Task:** E4:S03:T02 – Validate Kanban → Versioning integration in dev-kit  
**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**Author:** AI Agent (Auto)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive root cause analysis of why Task numbers are not correctly mapping to the version `TASK` component. The analysis identifies **4 primary root causes** and **6 contributing factors**, leading to **8 specific documentation and process gaps** that must be addressed to prevent recurrence.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**Symptom:** Task numbers are not correctly mapping to version `TASK` component. All Tasks within a Story are using `TASK=1`, with `BUILD` incrementing across Tasks (2, 3, 4, 5, 6...).

**Expected Behavior:**
- Task 1 → `v0.4.1.1+1` (Epic 4, Story 1, Task 1, Build 1)
- Task 2 → `v0.4.1.2+1` (Epic 4, Story 1, Task 2, Build 1)
- Task 3 → `v0.4.1.3+1` (Epic 4, Story 1, Task 3, Build 1)

**Actual Behavior:**
- Task 1 → `v0.4.1.1+2` (Epic 4, Story 1, Task 1, Build 2) ❌
- Task 2 → `v0.4.1.1+3` (Epic 4, Story 1, Task 1, Build 3) ❌
- Task 3 → `v0.4.1.1+4` (Epic 4, Story 1, Task 1, Build 4) ❌

**Impact:**
- Version numbers don't reflect actual Task progression
- Cannot distinguish between Tasks using version numbers alone
- Violates versioning schema rules
- Breaks forensic traceability (version → Task mapping is incorrect)

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### 2.1 Primary Root Cause: Missing Task Transition Detection in RW Step 2

**Root Cause:** Release Workflow Step 2 (Bump Version) does not explicitly detect Task transitions and update `VERSION_TASK` accordingly.

**Evidence:**
- RW Step 2 documentation says: "Determine if this is a task transition (would reset BUILD to 1)"
- But it does NOT say: "If task transition detected, UPDATE VERSION_TASK to match new Task number"
- RW Step 2 only increments BUILD, it doesn't check if we're on a new Task

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (Step 2)

**Why It Happened:**
- Step 2 was designed to handle BUILD increments within the same Task
- Task transitions were assumed to be handled elsewhere (intake process)
- No explicit instruction to detect and handle Task transitions in Step 2

---

### 2.2 Secondary Root Cause: No Validation of TASK Component

**Root Cause:** No validation checks that `VERSION_TASK` matches the active Task number before or during RW execution.

**Evidence:**
- `validate_branch_context.py` checks Epic/Story alignment but NOT Task alignment
- No validation in RW Step 2 to verify `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task
- No pre-commit hooks to enforce Task/version alignment

**Location:** 
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_branch_context.py`
- RW Step 2 validation section

**Why It Happened:**
- Validation was focused on Epic/Story alignment (branch context)
- Task-level validation was assumed to be handled by manual process
- No explicit requirement for Task/version validation

---

### 2.3 Tertiary Root Cause: Intake Process Doesn't Update version.py

**Root Cause:** FR/BR intake process assigns version numbers but doesn't explicitly update `version.py` with the new Task number.

**Evidence:**
- Intake guide says: "Assign version number: `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`"
- But it doesn't say: "Update `version.py` with `VERSION_TASK = <new_task_number>`"
- Intake process assumes `version.py` will be updated later (by RW or manually)

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/FR_BR_INTAKE_GUIDE.md` (Step 6)

**Why It Happened:**
- Intake process focuses on Kanban structure (Epic/Story/Task creation)
- Version assignment is documented but not enforced
- Assumption that RW will handle version file updates

---

### 2.4 Quaternary Root Cause: Documentation Ambiguity on Task Transitions

**Root Cause:** Documentation mentions Task transitions but doesn't provide clear, actionable steps for agents to follow.

**Evidence:**
- Kanban governance policy says: "Task transitions use `--task N` parameter"
- But RW agent execution guide doesn't mention `--task` parameter
- No clear distinction between "same Task, new BUILD" vs "new Task, reset BUILD"

**Location:**
- `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`

**Why It Happened:**
- Documentation evolved from different sources (Kanban policy vs RW guide)
- `--task` parameter concept from framework but not implemented in agent guide
- No single source of truth for Task transition handling

---

## 3. Contributing Factors

### 3.1 Manual Process Dependency

**Factor:** `VERSION_TASK` updates require manual intervention, which is error-prone.

**Impact:** Agents must remember to manually update `VERSION_TASK` when starting a new Task, but this step is easily forgotten.

**Evidence:** All completed Tasks show `TASK=1`, indicating manual updates were not consistently performed.

---

### 3.2 BUILD Increment Masks the Issue

**Factor:** RW automatically increments `BUILD`, which creates valid-looking version numbers even when `TASK` is incorrect.

**Impact:** The issue is not immediately obvious because version numbers still increment (BUILD), making it appear that the system is working correctly.

**Evidence:** Versions like `v0.4.1.1+2`, `v0.4.1.1+3` look valid but don't reflect Task progression.

---

### 3.3 No Clear "Start New Task" Workflow

**Factor:** There's no explicit workflow step for "starting a new Task" that triggers `VERSION_TASK` update.

**Impact:** Agents don't know when or how to update `VERSION_TASK` when moving to a new Task.

**Evidence:** No documentation explicitly says: "When starting Task 2, update `VERSION_TASK = 2` in `version.py`"

---

### 3.4 Version File Update Timing Ambiguity

**Factor:** Unclear when `version.py` should be updated: at Task creation, at RW start, or during RW execution.

**Impact:** Different agents may update `version.py` at different times, leading to inconsistencies.

**Evidence:** Some Tasks may have had `version.py` updated at creation, others during RW, others not at all.

---

### 3.5 Lack of Examples Showing Task Transitions

**Factor:** Documentation examples show BUILD increments but not Task transitions.

**Impact:** Agents don't have clear examples of how Task transitions should work.

**Evidence:** RW Step 2 examples show: `0.2.1.1+2` → `0.2.1.1+3` (same Task), but not: `0.2.1.1+1` → `0.2.1.2+1` (new Task)

---

### 3.6 No Pre-RW Validation Checklist

**Factor:** No checklist or validation step before RW execution to verify `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task.

**Impact:** Issues are only discovered after RW completes, requiring corrections.

**Evidence:** Validation happens in Step 8 (after version bump), not in Step 1 (before starting).

---

## 4. Documentation and Process Gaps

### 4.1 RW Step 2: Missing Task Transition Logic

**Gap:** Step 2 doesn't explicitly detect Task transitions and update `VERSION_TASK`.

**Required Fix:**
- Add explicit check: "Is this a new Task compared to previous release?"
- Add explicit action: "If new Task, update `VERSION_TASK` to match new Task number"
- Add explicit action: "If new Task, reset `VERSION_BUILD` to 1"

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (Step 2)

---

### 4.2 RW Step 1: Missing Task Validation

**Gap:** Step 1 (Branch Safety Check) doesn't validate that `VERSION_TASK` matches the active Task.

**Required Fix:**
- Add validation: "Verify `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task number from Story document"
- Add check: "If mismatch, STOP workflow and alert user"

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (Step 1)

---

### 4.3 Intake Guide: Missing version.py Update Step

**Gap:** Intake guide doesn't explicitly require updating `version.py` when creating a new Task.

**Required Fix:**
- Add step: "Update `version.py` with `VERSION_TASK = <new_task_number>`"
- Add validation: "Verify `VERSION_TASK` matches Task number"

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/FR_BR_INTAKE_GUIDE.md` (Step 6)

---

### 4.4 Validation Script: Missing Task Alignment Check

**Gap:** `validate_branch_context.py` doesn't check Task/version alignment.

**Required Fix:**
- Add check: "Verify `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task number"
- Add check: "Verify Task exists in Story document"

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/scripts/validation/validate_branch_context.py`

---

### 4.5 Versioning Policy: Missing Task Transition Rules

**Gap:** Versioning policy doesn't explicitly state how Task transitions should be handled.

**Required Fix:**
- Add section: "Task Transitions"
- Add rule: "When moving to a new Task, `VERSION_TASK` must be updated and `VERSION_BUILD` must reset to 1"
- Add examples showing Task transitions

**Location:** `KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md`

---

### 4.6 Kanban Governance: Missing version.py Update Requirement

**Gap:** Kanban governance policy mentions `--task` parameter but doesn't explain how agents should handle Task transitions.

**Required Fix:**
- Add section: "Version File Updates During Task Transitions"
- Add requirement: "When starting a new Task, `version.py` must be updated with new `VERSION_TASK`"
- Add requirement: "RW Step 2 must detect Task transitions and update `VERSION_TASK`"

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`

---

### 4.7 Agent Guide: Missing Task Transition Examples

**Gap:** Agent execution guide doesn't show examples of Task transitions.

**Required Fix:**
- Add example: "Moving from Task 1 to Task 2"
- Add example: "RW Step 2 handling Task transition"
- Add example: "Version file update during Task transition"

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`

---

### 4.8 Intake Agent Guide: Missing version.py Update

**Gap:** Intake agent guide doesn't mention updating `version.py` when creating Tasks.

**Required Fix:**
- Add step: "Update `version.py` with new Task number"
- Add validation: "Verify `VERSION_TASK` matches Task number"

**Location:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/FR_BR_INTAKE_AGENT_GUIDE.md`

---

## 5. Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

### 5.1 No Automated Validation

**Reason:** No automated checks to verify Task/version alignment.

**Impact:** Issues only discovered through manual review (validation report).

---

### 5.2 Documentation Assumed Manual Process

**Reason:** Documentation assumed agents would manually update `VERSION_TASK` when needed.

**Impact:** Manual process is error-prone and easily forgotten.

---

### 5.3 BUILD Increments Masked the Issue

**Reason:** BUILD increments made version numbers look valid even when TASK was incorrect.

**Impact:** Issue not immediately obvious during RW execution.

---

### 5.4 No Examples of Correct Task Transitions

**Reason:** Documentation examples only showed BUILD increments, not Task transitions.

**Impact:** Agents didn't have clear guidance on how Task transitions should work.

---

## 6. Prevention Strategy

### 6.1 Immediate Fixes

1. **Update RW Step 2:** Add explicit Task transition detection and `VERSION_TASK` update logic
2. **Update RW Step 1:** Add Task/version validation check
3. **Update Validation Script:** Add Task alignment validation
4. **Update Intake Guides:** Add explicit `version.py` update step

### 6.2 Process Improvements

1. **Add Pre-RW Checklist:** Verify `VERSION_TASK` matches active Task before starting RW
2. **Add Task Transition Examples:** Show correct Task transition handling in documentation
3. **Add Validation Hooks:** Pre-commit hooks to enforce Task/version alignment

### 6.3 Long-Term Solutions

1. **Automate Task Detection:** RW Step 2 automatically detects Task transitions
2. **Automate version.py Updates:** RW Step 2 automatically updates `VERSION_TASK` when Task transition detected
3. **Add Comprehensive Validation:** Multi-layer validation (pre-RW, during RW, post-RW)

---

## 7. Conclusion

The root cause of Task → version `TASK` component mapping failure is a **systemic documentation and process gap** across multiple files:

1. **RW Step 2** doesn't detect Task transitions and update `VERSION_TASK`
2. **RW Step 1** doesn't validate Task/version alignment
3. **Intake guides** don't require `version.py` updates
4. **Validation scripts** don't check Task alignment
5. **Versioning policy** doesn't explicitly state Task transition rules
6. **Kanban governance** doesn't explain Task transition handling
7. **Agent guides** don't show Task transition examples
8. **No validation** at any layer to catch the issue

**All 8 gaps must be addressed** to prevent recurrence. The fixes are documented in the updated policy and process documents.
