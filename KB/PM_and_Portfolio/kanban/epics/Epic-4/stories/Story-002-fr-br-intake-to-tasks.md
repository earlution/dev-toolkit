# Story 002 – FR/BR Intake to Tasks

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Created:** 2025-12-02  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-02 (v0.4.2.5+1 – Task 5 complete: Create intake workflow guide for agents/users - Story 2 COMPLETE)
**Version:** v0.4.2.5+1
**Code:** E4S02

---

## Overview

Design and implement a clear, actionable flow for converting incoming Feature Requests (FRs) and Bug Reports (BRs) into Kanban Tasks. This story ensures that all work entering the dev-kit is properly structured, tracked, and aligned with the Kanban → Versioning → Release Workflow system.

---

## Goal

Make it easy and systematic to go from an incoming Feature Request or Bug Report to:
- Task(s) under a Story
- Story under an Epic (creating them when missing)
- Proper versioning alignment (`RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`)

This story operationalizes the FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic rule defined in the Kanban governance policy.
