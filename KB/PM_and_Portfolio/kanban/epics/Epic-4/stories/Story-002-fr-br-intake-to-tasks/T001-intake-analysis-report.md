# FR/BR Intake Process Analysis Report

**Task:** E4:S02:T001 – Analyze current FR/BR intake process and requirements  
**Date:** 2025-12-02  
**Author:** AI Agent (Auto)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the current state of Feature Request (FR) and Bug Report (BR) intake processes in the `vibe-dev-kit` repository and identifies requirements for a systematic intake flow that converts FRs/BRs into Kanban Tasks.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Policy exists: FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic flow is defined in Kanban governance policy
- ❌ Process gap: No systematic intake process or templates exist
- ❌ Documentation gap: No step-by-step guide for converting FRs/BRs to Tasks
- ❌ Tooling gap: No templates or forms for FR/BR intake

**Recommendation:** Implement a complete intake system with templates, decision flows, and documentation.

---

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Policy Foundation

**Existing Policy:**
- **Location:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md` (framework)
- **Location:** `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md` (dev-kit implementation)

**Key Rules Defined:**
1. **FR/BR Source of Truth:**
   - Every FR and BR MUST result in at least one Kanban Task
   - Tasks must live under a Story
   - Stories must live under an Epic (once epics are in use)

2. **FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic Flow (Canonical Rule):**
   ```
   1. FR/BR arrives (issue tracker, support channel, notes, etc.)
   2. Check for existing Story that matches FR/BR scope
      → If found: create new Task under that Story
   3. If no Story exists:
      → Create new Story under appropriate Epic
   4. If no Epic exists:
      → Create new, conceptually broad Epic
      → Create Story under that Epic
      → Create Task under that Story
   ```

3. **Versioning Alignment:**
   - Tasks map to `TASK` component in `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
   - Stories map to `STORY` component
   - Epics map to `EPIC` component

### 1.2 Current Gaps

**Missing Components:**

1. **No Intake Templates:**
   - ❌ No FR template/form
   - ❌ No BR template/form
   - ❌ No standardized format for capturing FR/BR details

2. **No Decision Flow:**
   - ❌ No decision tree/flowchart for Story matching
   - ❌ No criteria for Epic matching/creation
   - ❌ No guidance on when to create new vs. use existing

3. **No Process Documentation:**
   - ❌ No step-by-step intake guide
   - ❌ No worked examples
   - ❌ No troubleshooting guide

4. **No Tooling:**
   - ❌ No automated intake scripts
   - ❌ No validation checks
   - ❌ No integration with issue trackers (if applicable)

5. **No Agent/User Guides:**
   - ❌ No guide for AI agents processing FRs/BRs
   - ❌ No guide for human users submitting FRs/BRs

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1 Use Case 1: Simple FR → Existing Story

**Actor:** User/Agent  
**Precondition:** FR arrives, matching Story exists  
**Flow:**
1. User/Agent receives FR
2. User/Agent searches for existing Story
3. Story found that matches FR scope
4. User/Agent creates new Task under existing Story
5. Task is added to Story's task checklist
6. Version is determined: `RC.EPIC.STORY.{NEXT_TASK}+1`

**Postcondition:** Task created, linked to Story, version assigned

### 3.2 Use Case 2: FR → New Story (Existing Epic)

**Actor:** User/Agent  
**Precondition:** FR arrives, no matching Story, but Epic exists  
**Flow:**
1. User/Agent receives FR
2. User/Agent searches for existing Story
3. No matching Story found
4. User/Agent identifies appropriate Epic
5. User/Agent creates new Story under Epic
6. User/Agent creates new Task under new Story
7. Story and Task are added to Kanban board
8. Version is determined: `RC.EPIC.{NEXT_STORY}.1+1`

**Postcondition:** Story and Task created, linked to Epic, version assigned

### 3.3 Use Case 3: FR → New Epic

**Actor:** User/Agent  
**Precondition:** FR arrives, no matching Story or Epic  
**Flow:**
1. User/Agent receives FR
2. User/Agent searches for existing Story
3. No matching Story found
4. User/Agent searches for existing Epic
5. No matching Epic found
6. User/Agent creates new, conceptually broad Epic
7. User/Agent creates new Story under new Epic
8. User/Agent creates new Task under new Story
9. Epic, Story, and Task are added to Kanban board
10. Version is determined: `RC.{NEXT_EPIC}.1.1+1`

**Postcondition:** Epic, Story, and Task created, version assigned

### 3.4 Use Case 4: Complex FR → Multiple Tasks

**Actor:** User/Agent  
**Precondition:** FR arrives that requires multiple Tasks  
**Flow:**
1. User/Agent receives FR
2. User/Agent analyzes FR scope
3. User/Agent determines FR requires multiple Tasks
4. User/Agent creates multiple Tasks (under same or different Stories)
5. Each Task is properly linked and versioned
6. Tasks are added to appropriate Stories

**Postcondition:** Multiple Tasks created, properly linked and versioned

### 3.5 Use Case 5: BR → Bug Fix Task

**Actor:** User/Agent  
**Precondition:** BR arrives  
**Flow:**
1. User/Agent receives BR
2. User/Agent identifies affected area/component
3. User/Agent searches for existing Story related to that area
4. If found: create Task under existing Story
5. If not found: follow Story/Epic creation flow
6. Task is marked as bug fix
7. Version is determined based on Story/Epic

**Postcondition:** Bug fix Task created, properly linked and versioned
