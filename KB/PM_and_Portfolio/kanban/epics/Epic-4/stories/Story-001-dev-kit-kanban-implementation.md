# Story 001 – Dev Kit Kanban Implementation

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Created:** 2025-12-02  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-02 (v0.4.1.1+6 – Task 5 complete: Document consumption pattern for other projects - Story COMPLETE)
**Version:** v0.4.1.1+6  
**Code:** E4S01

---

## Overview

Fully align the dev-kit Kanban board, stories, and governance policy with the Kanban framework package. This story ensures that `vibe-dev-kit` serves as the **single point of truth (SoT)** for Kanban policies, templates, and governance, which other projects (like `fynd.deals`) can copy and adapt.

---

## Goal

Establish `vibe-dev-kit` as the canonical source for Kanban framework policies, templates, and governance. Ensure that findings from real-world implementations (e.g., `fynd.deals` Epic 15) are captured and refined into reusable framework components.

### E4:S01:T001 – Review existing dev-kit Kanban policies and templates ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Current dev-kit Kanban framework files  
**Deliverable:** Gap analysis report ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Gap analysis documented in `T001-gap-analysis-report.md`

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Reviewed `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`
2. ✅ Reviewed `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md`
3. ✅ Reviewed `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md`
4. ✅ Reviewed `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/STORY_TEMPLATE.md`
5. ✅ Reviewed `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md`
6. ✅ Compared framework policy with dev-kit policy
7. ✅ Compared framework templates with dev-kit usage
8. ✅ Documented gaps and inconsistencies

**Key Findings:**

- **Template gaps:** Missing "ALL sections" update requirement notes, forensic marker format standardization notes, consistency check reminders
- **Dev-kit policy gaps:** Missing framework principles (Harmonious Cycle, detailed FR/BR flow, Task-Level Requirements, Release Workflow documentation)

**Deliverable:** See [`T001-gap-analysis-report.md`](T001-gap-analysis-report.md) for complete gap analysis report.

### E4:S01:T002 – Ingest findings from fynd.deals Epic 15 Kanban work into dev-kit ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** fynd.deals Epic 15 Kanban documentation (via framework packages)  
**Deliverable:** Summary of reusable patterns and findings ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** E4:S01:T001  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Findings documented in `T002-fynd-deals-epic15-kanban-findings.md`

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Reviewed framework packages for fynd.deals Epic 15 patterns
2. ✅ Extracted reusable patterns from workflow management integration docs
3. ✅ Identified 7 key patterns:
   - Atomic RW behaviour (complete all steps or explicit BLOCKED state)
   - "ALL sections" update requirement (systematic documentation consistency)
   - Accessibility constraints (no partial updates, no silent failures, clear messages)
   - Forensic marker requirements and consistency checks
   - Review schedules and maintenance responsibilities
   - Escalation procedures
   - Mandatory TODO tracking
4. ✅ Documented findings and recommendations

**Key Findings:**
- **7 patterns identified:** All patterns are documented in workflow management package but missing from Kanban governance policy
- **9 recommendations provided:** High priority updates to `kanban-governance-policy.md`, medium priority updates to templates
- **Patterns already in framework:** Atomic RW, "ALL sections", TODO tracking are in workflow package
- **Patterns missing from policy:** All 7 patterns need explicit documentation in Kanban governance policy

**Deliverable:** See [`T002-fynd-deals-epic15-kanban-findings.md`](T002-fynd-deals-epic15-kanban-findings.md) for complete findings and recommendations.

**Files Reviewed:**
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md`
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`
- ✅ `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-4/stories/Story-001-dev-kit-kanban-implementation/T001-gap-analysis-report.md`

**Key Patterns to Capture:**
- Atomic RW behaviour: RW must complete all 10 steps or stop with explicit BLOCKED message
- "ALL sections" rule: Epic docs must update header, Story Checklist, AND detailed story sections
- Accessibility constraints: No partial updates, no silent failures, clear actionable messages
- Forensic marker format: `✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)` canonical format
- Consistency requirements: Kanban Board ↔ Epic ↔ Story must all align

### E4:S01:T003 – Update dev-kit Kanban governance policy as canonical SoT ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Findings from T001 and T002  
**Deliverable:** Updated canonical Kanban governance policy ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** E4:S01:T001, E4:S01:T002  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Framework policy updated with all 9 operational principles sections

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Added 9 Operational Principles sections to `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md`:
   - Atomic Release Workflow Behaviour
   - "ALL Sections" Update Requirement
   - Accessibility Constraints
   - Forensic Marker Standardization

   - Review Schedules
   - Maintenance Responsibilities
   - Escalation Procedures

2. ✅ Updated `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md` to clearly reference framework policy as CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH
3. ✅ Documented relationship between framework policy (SoT) and project-specific adaptations

**Key Changes:**
- **Framework Policy:** Added comprehensive "Operational Principles" section with all 9 subsections
- **Dev-Kit Policy:** Enhanced "Relationship to Framework Package" section to explicitly state framework is canonical SoT
- **Change History:** Updated to reflect new sections added

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md` (primary SoT - major update)
- ✅ `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/rituals/policy/kanban-governance-policy.md` (dev-kit local policy - enhanced SoT reference)

**Deliverable:** Framework policy now serves as comprehensive canonical SoT with all operational principles explicitly documented.

**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Both templates updated with governance alignment notes

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Updated `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md`:

**Template Enhancements:**
- Explicit forensic marker format in task checklists
- Notes about "ALL sections" update requirements

### E4:S01:T005 – Document consumption pattern for other projects ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Updated policies and templates from T003-T004  
**Deliverable:** Consumption documentation ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** E4:S01:T003, E4:S01:T004  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Comprehensive consumption pattern documented in README

**Approach:**
1. ✅ Updated `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md` with comprehensive "Consumption Pattern for Other Projects" section:
   - Why copy, don't reference (independence, customization, ownership)
   - What to copy (required vs optional files)
   - Customization boundaries (what can vs must not customize)
   - Update process (when and how to sync with framework)
   - Single Source of Truth relationship
   - Implementation steps (step-by-step guide)
   - Example: New project setup
   - Key principles summary
2. ✅ Documented relationship between framework (SoT) and project implementations
3. ✅ Provided clear guidance on customization boundaries and update process

**Key Documentation:**
- **Copy, Don't Reference:** Projects must copy files, not link to `vibe-dev-kit`
- **Customization Boundaries:** 
  - ✅ CAN customize: File paths, project names, terminology, Epic ranges, branch conventions, board structure
  - ❌ MUST NOT customize: Operational principles, forensic marker format, Story Checklist as SoT, governance rules, version schema structure
- **Update Process:** Step-by-step workflow for syncing with framework updates
- **SoT Relationship:** `vibe-dev-kit` is canonical source, projects are adaptations

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md` (added comprehensive consumption pattern section)

**Deliverable:** README now includes complete consumption pattern documentation, enabling other projects to properly adopt and maintain the Kanban framework.
