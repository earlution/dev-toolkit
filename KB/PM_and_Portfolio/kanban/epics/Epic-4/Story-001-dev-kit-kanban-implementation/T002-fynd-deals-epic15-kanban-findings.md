# Task 2 Findings: fynd.deals Epic 15 Kanban Patterns

**Task:** E4:S01:T02 – Ingest findings from fynd.deals Epic 15 Kanban work into dev-kit  
**Created:** 2025-12-02  
**Status:** Complete  
**Deliverable:** Summary of reusable Kanban patterns and findings

---

## Executive Summary

This document captures reusable Kanban patterns extracted from the fynd.deals Epic 15 work, as reflected in the `packages/frameworks/kanban/` and `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/` framework packages. The framework packages already contain refined Kanban governance, workflow integration, and operational patterns developed in fynd.deals Epic 15.

**Key Finding:** The framework packages **already contain** many fynd.deals Epic 15 findings, particularly in:
- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md`
- `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md`

However, **critical operational principles** identified in T001 gap analysis are **not yet explicitly documented** in the Kanban governance policy itself. This document extracts these patterns and provides recommendations for explicit documentation.

## 1. Atomic Release Workflow (RW) Behaviour Pattern

### Pattern: Complete All Steps or Explicit BLOCKED State

**Source:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (lines 250-288)  
**Source:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md` (lines 250-288)

**Pattern Definition:**
```yaml
atomicity:
  introduced_in: "VWMP v2.0.0"
  purpose: "Ensure clear workflow status (accessibility-critical)"
  
  requirement: |
    When user types 'RW', agent MUST either:
    - Complete all 11 steps to completion, OR
    - Stop at specific step with clear 'RW BLOCKED' message
```

**Blocked Protocol:**
```yaml
if_blocked:
  agent_must_state:
    - step: "Step number and name (e.g., 'Step 7: Run Validators')"
    - reason: "Why blocked (e.g., wrong branch, missing tool, sandbox limitation)"
    - actions: "Exact commands user must run to unblock"
    - status: "That RW is NOT complete until actions taken"
  
  agent_must_not:
    - "Silently stop mid-workflow after modifying files"
    - "Start new RW while previous RW TODOs are pending/in_progress"
  
  if_abandoned:
    - "Mark remaining rw-step-* TODOs as cancelled"
    - "Output short 'RW ABORTED' summary"
    - "State current state and next steps"
```

**Rationale:**
- **Accessibility:** Critical for users with cognitive constraints
- **Clarity:** User always knows workflow status
- **Safety:** Prevents ambiguous states

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Documented in workflow management package
- ❌ **NOT explicitly documented in Kanban governance policy**

**Recommendation:** Add explicit section to `kanban-governance-policy.md` documenting atomic RW behaviour as a core Kanban operational principle.

---

## 2. "ALL Sections" Update Requirement Pattern

### Pattern: Systematic Documentation Consistency

**Source:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md` (lines 87-112)  
**Source:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/README.md` (lines 194-201)

**Pattern Definition:**
```yaml
all_sections:
  introduced_in: "VWMP v2.0.0"
  purpose: "Prevent documentation inconsistencies"
  
  requirement: |
    Step 4 (Update KB Epic Docs) MUST update:
    - Header metadata (Last updated field)
    - Story Checklist (status and version marker)
    - Detailed story sections (Status, Last updated, task checkboxes)
    - Any other references to the story/task being released
  
  systematic_process:
    1: "Read the FULL Epic-{epic}.md file"
    2: "Read the authoritative Story-{N}-{Name}.md file to get correct state"
    3: "Find ALL sections referencing the story/task (grep/search the file)"
    4: "Update ALL of them to match the Story file's state"
    5: "Validate consistency: header, checklist, and detailed sections must all match"
```

**Enforcement:**
- `.cursorrules` explicitly requires 'ALL sections'
- Release Workflow documentation emphasizes systematic process
- Agents must follow ANALYZE → DETERMINE → EXECUTE → VALIDATE → PROCEED pattern

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Documented in workflow management package
- ✅ Documented in workflow-Kanban integration guide
- ❌ **NOT explicitly documented in Kanban governance policy**

**Recommendation:** Add explicit section to `kanban-governance-policy.md` documenting "ALL sections" requirement as a core Kanban operational principle, with systematic process steps.

---

## 3. Accessibility Constraints Pattern

### Pattern: No Partial Updates, No Silent Failures, Clear Actionable Messages

**Source:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md` (lines 250-288)  
**Source:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/README.md` (lines 387, 424-425)

**Pattern Definition:**
```yaml
accessibility_constraints:
  introduced_in: "VWMP v2.0.0"
  purpose: "Critical for users with cognitive constraints"
  
  requirements:
    no_partial_updates:
      - "RW must complete all steps OR stop with explicit BLOCKED message"
      - "Cannot silently stop mid-workflow after modifying files"
      - "Cannot leave documentation in inconsistent state"
    
    no_silent_failures:
      - "Must state step number and name when blocked"
      - "Must state reason for blocking"
      - "Must provide exact commands to unblock"
      - "Must state that RW is NOT complete"
    
    clear_actionable_messages:
      - "RW BLOCKED: Step X - Reason - Actions required"
      - "RW ABORTED: Current state - Next steps"
      - "RW COMPLETE: All 11 steps completed successfully"
```

**Rationale:**
- **Cognitive accessibility:** Users with cognitive constraints need clear, unambiguous status
- **Error recovery:** Clear messages enable users to understand and fix issues
- **Trust:** Users can verify workflow completion status

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Documented in workflow management package (implicitly)
- ❌ **NOT explicitly documented in Kanban governance policy**

**Recommendation:** Add explicit section to `kanban-governance-policy.md` documenting accessibility constraints as core Kanban operational principles.

---

## 4. Forensic Marker Requirements and Consistency Checks Pattern

### Pattern: Standardized Format and Consistency Validation

**Source:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md` (lines 72-85)  
**Source:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/policies/kanban-governance-policy.md` (implicit in examples)

**Pattern Definition:**
```yaml
forensic_markers:
  format: "✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)"
  examples:
    story: "- [x] **Story 33 – Parent Inclusivity** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.33.3+1)"
    task: "- [x] **E4:S33:T01 – Task Name** ✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.33.1+1)"
  
  location:
    story_checklist: "Epic-{epic}.md, Story Checklist section (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)"
    task_checklist: "Story-{N}-{Name}.md, Task Checklist section"
    detailed_sections: "Epic-{epic}.md, detailed story sections (for consistency)"
  
  consistency_requirements:
    - "Story Checklist is SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH"
    - "Detailed sections must match Story Checklist"
    - "Header 'Last updated' must match version in markers"
    - "ALL sections must be updated together"
```

**Validation Checks:**
```yaml
consistency_checks:
  epic_header:
    - "Last updated field matches version in Story Checklist"
    - "Version format matches RC.E.S.T+B schema"
  
  story_checklist:
    - "Version marker present and correctly formatted"
    - "Status checkbox matches Story file status"
  
  detailed_sections:
    - "Status matches Story Checklist"
    - "Last updated matches Story Checklist"
    - "Task checkboxes match Story file"
  
  cross_references:
    - "No duplicate progress sections"
    - "All references to story/task are consistent"
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Format shown in examples throughout framework
- ⚠️ **Partially documented** in workflow-Kanban integration guide
- ❌ **NOT explicitly standardized** in Kanban governance policy

**Recommendation:** Add explicit section to `kanban-governance-policy.md` documenting:
- Canonical forensic marker format (`✅ COMPLETE (vRC.E.S.T+B)`)
- Consistency requirements (Kanban Board ↔ Epic ↔ Story)
- Validation checklist for consistency checks

---

## 5. Review Schedules and Maintenance Responsibilities Pattern

### Pattern: Regular Review and Maintenance Cadence

**Source:** Gap analysis identified this as missing from framework policy

**Pattern Definition:**
```yaml
review_schedules:
  epic_reviews:
    frequency: "After each story completion"
    responsibility: "Epic owner / Story owner"
    checks:
      - "Epic header 'Last updated' current"
      - "Story Checklist accurate"
      - "Detailed sections match Story files"
      - "Dependencies and risks updated"
  
  story_reviews:
    frequency: "After each task completion"
    responsibility: "Story owner"
    checks:
      - "Story status accurate"
      - "Task Checklist accurate"
      - "Acceptance criteria met"
      - "Dependencies updated"
  
  board_reviews:
    frequency: "Weekly or after significant changes"
    responsibility: "Project manager / Kanban maintainer"
    checks:
      - "Board view matches Epic docs"
      - "Status columns accurate"
      - "No orphaned stories/tasks"
      - "Epic priorities current"
  
  policy_reviews:
    frequency: "Quarterly or after major framework updates"
    responsibility: "Framework maintainer"
    checks:
      - "Policy aligns with framework updates"
      - "Templates match policy"
      - "Integration guides current"
```

**Maintenance Responsibilities:**
```yaml
maintenance:
  epic_owner:
    - "Update Epic header after story completion"
    - "Update Story Checklist after story completion"
    - "Update detailed sections after story completion"
    - "Review dependencies and risks regularly"
  
  story_owner:
    - "Update Story status after task completion"
    - "Update Task Checklist after task completion"
    - "Update acceptance criteria status"
    - "Review dependencies regularly"
  
  kanban_maintainer:
    - "Update board views regularly"
    - "Ensure board ↔ Epic ↔ Story consistency"
    - "Review for orphaned items"
    - "Coordinate policy updates"
```

**Current Status:**
- ❌ **NOT documented** in framework policy
- ❌ **NOT documented** in templates

**Recommendation:** Add explicit section to `kanban-governance-policy.md` documenting:
- Review schedules (frequency, responsibility, checks)
- Maintenance responsibilities (who does what, when)
- Escalation procedures (when reviews are missed, who to notify)

---

## 6. Escalation Procedures Pattern

### Pattern: Clear Escalation Path for Issues

**Source:** Gap analysis identified this as missing from framework policy

**Pattern Definition:**
```yaml
escalation_procedures:
  documentation_inconsistencies:
    severity: "High"
    trigger: "Epic header, Story Checklist, and detailed sections don't match"
    action:
      1: "Identify authoritative source (Story file)"
      2: "Update ALL sections to match authoritative source"
      3: "Document inconsistency in changelog if significant"
      4: "Notify Epic owner and Kanban maintainer"
  
  missing_reviews:
    severity: "Medium"
    trigger: "Review schedule missed (e.g., Epic not updated after story completion)"
    action:
      1: "Remind Epic owner of review responsibility"
      2: "If no response after 2 days, escalate to Kanban maintainer"
      3: "Kanban maintainer updates or assigns alternative owner"
  
  policy_violations:
    severity: "High"
    trigger: "Work item doesn't follow Kanban governance policy"
    action:
      1: "Identify violation (e.g., missing forensic marker, inconsistent status)"
      2: "Notify work item owner"
      3: "Provide guidance on correct format/process"
      4: "If repeated, escalate to Kanban maintainer"
  
  blocked_workflows:
    severity: "Medium"
    trigger: "RW blocked and not resolved after 24 hours"
    action:
      1: "Review blocked reason"
      2: "Assist with unblocking (if technical issue)"
      3: "If user action required, remind user"
      4: "If abandoned, mark RW as ABORTED and document"
```

**Escalation Contacts:**
```yaml
contacts:
  epic_owner: "First point of contact for Epic-level issues"
  story_owner: "First point of contact for Story-level issues"
  kanban_maintainer: "Second point of contact for policy violations and consistency issues"
  framework_maintainer: "Final point of contact for framework-level issues"
```

**Current Status:**
- ❌ **NOT documented** in framework policy

**Recommendation:** Add explicit section to `kanban-governance-policy.md` documenting:
- Escalation procedures for common issues
- Escalation contacts and responsibilities
- Severity levels and response times

## 7. Mandatory TODO Tracking Pattern

### Pattern: Real-Time Progress Visibility

**Source:** `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/release-workflow-agent-execution.md` (lines 292-344)  
**Source:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/integration/workflow-management-integration.md` (lines 292-344)

**Pattern Definition:**
```yaml
todo_tracking:
  introduced_in: "VWMP v2.0.0"
  requirement: "MANDATORY (not optional)"
  purpose: "Real-time progress visibility"
  
  implementation:
    at_workflow_start:
      action: "Create TODO list with all 11 steps"
      status: "pending"
    
    before_each_step:
      action: "Mark step as in_progress"
    
    after_each_step:
      action: "Mark step as completed, next as in_progress"
    
    on_completion:
      action: "All steps marked as completed"
  
  enforcement:
    - "DO NOT execute Release Workflow without creating TODO list first"
    - "DO NOT skip TODO updates between steps"
    - "MUST create TODO list before Step 1 execution"
    - "MUST update TODO status before and after each step"
    - "MUST mark all steps as completed on successful completion"
```

**Benefits:**
- User visibility: User sees real-time progress through all steps
- Agent organization: Helps agent stay organized across sequential steps
- Error recovery: Clear visibility into where execution stopped if interrupted
- Transparency: User can verify all steps completed successfully
- Accessibility: Critical for users with cognitive constraints

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Documented in workflow management package
- ❌ **NOT explicitly documented in Kanban governance policy**

**Recommendation:** Add explicit section to `kanban-governance-policy.md` documenting mandatory TODO tracking as a core operational principle for agent-driven workflows.
