## Tasks

### E5:S01:T01 – Conduct comprehensive documentation hygiene analysis

**Input:** Entire documentation corpus (`KB/`, `packages/frameworks/`, root docs)  
**Deliverable:** Documentation hygiene analysis report with categorized issues and recommendations  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None

**Problem Statement:**
Before establishing documentation maintenance policies, we need a comprehensive understanding of the current documentation state. This analysis will identify all documentation issues, inconsistencies, and maintenance needs across the entire dev-kit repository.

**Approach:**

1. **Inventory Documentation Corpus:**
   - Map all documentation files across `KB/`, `packages/frameworks/`, and root directories
   - Categorize by type (policies, guides, ADRs, templates, Kanban docs, changelogs)
   - Identify documentation owners and lifecycle metadata
   - Create documentation structure map

2. **Analyze Documentation Issues:**
   - **Broken Links:** Check all internal and external links for validity
   - **Outdated Information:** Identify references to deprecated features, old versions, outdated examples
   - **Inconsistencies:** Cross-reference related docs for conflicting information
   - **Orphaned Files:** Find documentation with no references or unclear purpose
   - **Version Mismatches:** Check version numbers, dates, and metadata consistency
   - **Missing Documentation:** Identify gaps where documentation should exist
   - **Format Inconsistencies:** Check adherence to templates and style guides
   - **Documentation Drift:** Compare actual code/implementation with documented behavior

3. **Categorize Issues by Severity:**
   - **Critical:** Issues that cause confusion, errors, or block understanding
   - **High:** Issues that significantly impact usability or accuracy
   - **Medium:** Issues that cause minor confusion or inconsistency
   - **Low:** Issues that are cosmetic or minor improvements

4. **Analyze Documentation Patterns:**
   - Identify common anti-patterns (e.g., copying docs instead of using templates)
   - Document recurring issues and their root causes
   - Analyze documentation update frequency and patterns
   - Identify documentation hotspots (files that change frequently)

5. **Create Hygiene Report:**
   - Executive summary with key findings
   - Detailed issue inventory with file locations
   - Categorized issues by type and severity
