# Story 002 – Package & Repo Architecture

**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Created:** 2025-12-02  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-02 (v0.1.2.2+1 – Task 2 complete: Modularity principles documented)  
**Version:** v0.1.2.2+1  
**Code:** E1S02

---

## Overview

This story clarifies the **modular architecture** of the `vibe-dev-kit` repository, ensuring that users can easily consume individual frameworks (workflow mgt, versioning, kanban) without pulling in the entire repository. It establishes clear boundaries, dependencies, and consumption patterns for each package.

---

## Goal

Make it easy for users to consume **individual frameworks** (workflow mgt, versioning, kanban) without pulling in the whole repo. Establish clear modularity principles, dependency documentation, and consumption patterns.

## Tasks

### E1:S02:T001 – Analyze current package structure and dependencies ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Current repository structure, package READMEs, and framework documentation  
**Deliverable:** Package structure analysis report ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Analysis report created in `T001-package-structure-analysis.md`

**Key Findings:**
- All three framework packages are designed to be modular and can be used standalone
- Some implicit dependencies exist that should be made explicit
- Documentation of dependencies is inconsistent across packages
- Modularity gaps identified in documentation, structure, and consumption patterns

**Deliverable:** Complete package structure analysis report with dependency matrix, modularity gaps, and recommendations.

**Approach:**
1. Review current `packages/frameworks/` structure
2. Identify dependencies between packages
3. Document current modularity gaps
4. Identify what makes packages independent vs interdependent

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete analysis of current package structure
- [ ] Dependencies between packages documented
- [ ] Modularity gaps identified
- [ ] Report created with findings

---

### E1:S02:T002 – Document modularity principles and boundaries ✅ COMPLETE

**Input:** Analysis from T001  
**Deliverable:** Modularity principles document ✅ **DELIVERED**  
**Dependencies:** T001  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Modularity principles document created in `T002-modularity-principles.md`

**Key Deliverables:**
- Defined what "modular" means for vibe-dev-kit
- Established package boundaries for all three packages
- Documented copy vs reference patterns
- Defined dependency rules (hard vs soft/optional)
- Documented package independence rules
- Established consumption patterns (standalone, combined, incremental)
- Defined customization boundaries
- Documented integration patterns

**Deliverable:** Complete modularity principles document with boundaries, dependency rules, and consumption patterns.

**Approach:**
1. Define what "modular" means for this dev-kit
2. Establish boundaries between packages
3. Document copy vs reference patterns
4. Define dependency rules

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Modularity principles clearly defined
- [ ] Package boundaries documented
- [ ] Copy vs reference patterns established
- [ ] Dependency rules documented

---

### E1:S02:T003 – Create package dependency matrix

**Input:** Analysis from T001, principles from T002  
**Deliverable:** Dependency matrix document  
**Dependencies:** T001, T002  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ⏳ TODO

**Approach:**
1. Create visual dependency matrix
2. Document optional vs required dependencies
3. Identify circular dependencies (if any)
4. Document how to break dependencies if needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dependency matrix created
- [ ] Optional vs required dependencies clear
- [ ] Circular dependencies identified and resolved
- [ ] Breaking dependencies documented

---

### E1:S02:T004 – Document consumption patterns for each framework

**Input:** Principles from T002, dependency matrix from T003  
**Deliverable:** Consumption pattern guides for each framework  
**Dependencies:** T002, T003  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ⏳ TODO

**Approach:**
1. Create consumption guide for Workflow Management framework
2. Create consumption guide for Numbering & Versioning framework
3. Create consumption guide for Kanban framework
4. Include examples of standalone vs combined usage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Consumption guide for each framework created
- [ ] Standalone usage documented
- [ ] Combined usage documented
- [ ] Examples provided

---

### E1:S02:T005 – Update package READMEs with modularity information

**Input:** Consumption patterns from T004  
**Deliverable:** Updated package READMEs  
**Dependencies:** T004  
**Blocker:** None

**Status:** ⏳ TODO

**Approach:**
1. Update `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/README.md`
2. Update `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/README.md`
3. Update `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md`
4. Ensure all READMEs include modularity section

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All package READMEs updated
- [ ] Modularity section in each README
- [ ] Dependencies clearly documented
- [ ] Consumption patterns referenced

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Package structure analyzed and documented
- [ ] Modularity principles established
- [ ] Dependency matrix created
- [ ] Consumption patterns documented for all frameworks
- [ ] All package READMEs updated with modularity information
- [ ] Users can easily understand how to use individual packages independently

---

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**

**Blocked By:**
- None (can proceed independently)

**Coordinates With:**
- Epic 2: Workflow Management Framework
- Epic 3: Numbering & Versioning Framework
- Epic 4: Kanban Framework

---

## References

- `packages/frameworks/workflow mgt/README.md`
- `packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/README.md`
- `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md`
- `README.md` (root)
