# Bug Report: Missing Migration Support for Pre-Existing Kanban Structures

**Type:** Bug Report (BR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-01-27  
**Submitted By:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as user/client for dev-toolkit  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**GitHub Issue:** [#2](https://github.com/earlution/ai-dev-kit/issues/2)

---

## Summary

The Kanban framework installation process assumes a fresh install with no existing Kanban structure. When projects have pre-existing Kanban (or Sprint/Agile) systems, the framework cannot detect, analyze, preserve, or migrate existing work items, creating risk of data loss and adoption barriers.

---

## Description

### What is the Bug?

The Kanban framework installation process (`packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md`) assumes:
- ✅ Fresh project with no existing Kanban structure
- ✅ Clean slate for Epic/Story/Task setup
- ✅ No migration needed from existing systems

**Reality:** Many projects have pre-existing Kanban, Sprint, or Agile structures that need to be preserved and migrated.

### What Should Happen vs. What Actually Happens?

**Expected Behavior:**
1. User requests Kanban structure setup: "I want you to setup our Kanban structure, using the [updated] Kanban pack from ai-dev-kit"
2. Framework detects existing Kanban structure (if present)
3. Framework analyzes existing work items
4. Framework preserves existing work
5. Framework migrates existing items to canonical E/S/T structure
6. Framework installs/updates structure safely without data loss

**Actual Behavior:**
1. User requests Kanban structure setup
2. Framework assumes fresh install (no detection)
3. Framework provides templates (assumes clean slate)
4. Risk of overwriting existing work if installed naively
5. No migration utilities available
6. Manual migration required (error-prone)

### When Does It Occur?

This bug occurs whenever:
- A project has pre-existing Kanban structure
- A project has Sprint-based agile system
- A project has issue tracker integration (GitHub Issues, Jira)
- A project is updating from older framework version
- An agent/user tries to install framework over existing structure

### Who is Affected?

**Primary Affected:**
- Projects with existing Kanban systems
- Projects migrating from Sprint-based systems
- Projects with issue tracker integration
- Projects updating framework versions
- AI agents automating Kanban setup

**Secondary Affected:**
- Framework adoption (barriers to entry)
- Framework credibility (appears incomplete)
- User experience (frustration with manual migration)

---

## Affected Component

**Primary Component:** Kanban Framework - Installation Process  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Installation Process
- [x] Migration Utilities
- [x] Detection Mechanisms
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Backend/API
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [ ] Integration/External Service

**Root Cause:**
The framework installation process was designed for fresh installs only. No consideration was given to projects with pre-existing Kanban structures. The framework lacks:
- Detection utilities for existing structures
- Analysis tools for mapping existing work
- Migration utilities for converting existing items
- Installation modes for different scenarios

---

## Steps to Reproduce

### UAT Scenario: Installing Framework with Pre-Existing Kanban

**Context:** dev-toolkit project has pre-existing Kanban structure

1. **Existing State:** Project has Epic 1 with 2 complete stories
   - Epic 1: Tool Management and Registry System
   - Story 1: Tool Management System (COMPLETE)
   - Story 2: Tool Distribution Strategy (COMPLETE)

2. **User Request:** "I want you to setup our Kanban structure, using the [updated] Kanban pack from ai-dev-kit"

3. **Agent Action:** Agent reads framework documentation
   - Reads `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md`
   - Finds installation steps assume fresh install
   - No detection utilities found
   - No migration utilities found

4. **Agent Assumption:** Agent assumes fresh install
   - No way to detect existing structure
   - No way to preserve existing work
   - Risk of overwriting Epic 1

5. **User Discovery:** User identifies gap
   - Framework doesn't handle pre-existing structures
   - No migration path available
   - Manual migration required

**Expected Result:**
- Framework detects existing Epic 1
- Framework preserves existing work
- Framework migrates existing items to canonical structure
- Framework installs/updates safely

**Actual Result:**
- Framework cannot detect existing structure
- Framework cannot preserve existing work
- Framework cannot migrate existing items
- Risk of data loss if installed naively

---

## Environment

**Environment:** Development (Framework Installation)  
**Version:** Kanban Framework v2.0.0 (as of 2025-12-10)  
**Repository:** earlution/dev-toolkit (consuming ai-dev-kit framework)  
**Framework Source:** earlution/ai-dev-kit  
**Framework Path:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/`  
**Affected Files:**
- `packages/frameworks/kanban/README.md` (installation process)
- Missing: Detection utilities
- Missing: Migration utilities
- Missing: Installation mode selection

---

## Impact

### User Impact

**Severity:** HIGH

**Impact Description:**
- **Critical:** Risk of overwriting existing work during installation
- **High:** No migration path from existing Kanban systems
- **High:** Manual migration required (error-prone, time-consuming)
- **Medium:** Framework adoption barriers for projects with existing structures
- **Medium:** Confusion about installation process

**User Experience:**
- Users with existing Kanban cannot safely adopt framework
- Users must manually migrate (risky, time-consuming)
- Framework appears incomplete compared to user needs
- Installation process doesn't match real-world scenarios

### Business Impact

**Framework Adoption:**
- Projects with existing Kanban may abandon framework
- Framework appears incomplete for real-world use
- Framework credibility affected by missing migration support

**Framework Evolution:**
- Missing critical use case (pre-existing structures)
- Framework doesn't address common scenario
- Adoption barriers reduce framework value

### Workaround

**Current Workaround:**
1. Manually backup existing structure
2. Manually analyze existing work items
3. Manually migrate existing items to canonical structure
4. Manually preserve forensic markers and work history
5. Manually install framework around existing structure

**Workaround Limitations:**
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Requires deep framework knowledge
- Risk of data loss
- Doesn't solve root cause
- Not scalable across projects
