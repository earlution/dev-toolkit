# Bug Report: Kanban Framework Epic Structure Gap (UAT Finding)

**Type:** Bug Report (BR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-01-27  
**Submitted By:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as user/client  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** ACCEPTED

---

## Summary

The Kanban framework's CANONICAL_EPICS.md only documents Epics 1-7, but the expected structure includes Epics 1-21, where Epics 1-8 are CORE (always installed) and Epics 9-21 are ANCILLARY (users pick and choose). This gap prevents users from getting the expected epic structure during framework installation.

---

## Description

**What is the Bug?**

The Kanban framework documentation (`packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/CANONICAL_EPICS.md`) is incomplete. It only documents 7 canonical epics (Epics 1-7), but the framework is expected to provide 21 epics total:

- **Core Epics (1-8):** Always installed
- **Ancillary Epics (9-21):** Users pick and choose

Additionally, Epic 7 (UXR) is missing entirely, and Epic 7 (Codebase Maintenance) should be Epic 8.

**What Should Happen vs. What Actually Happens?**

**Expected Behavior:**
- User requests Kanban structure setup: "I want you to setup our Kanban structure, using the [updated] Kanban pack from ai-dev-kit"
- Framework provides complete epic structure:
  - Core epics (1-8) automatically installed
  - Ancillary epics (9-21) available for selection
  - All epics properly numbered and documented
  - Installation process creates epic templates from canonical definitions
- User gets expected 21-epic structure with proper numbering

**Actual Behavior:**
- User requests Kanban structure setup
- Agent reads `CANONICAL_EPICS.md` and finds only Epics 1-7
- Agent creates incorrect Epic 1 for dev-toolkit (should use canonical Epic 1 template)
- User discovers structure doesn't match expectations
- User identifies gap: Missing Epic 7 (UXR), Epic 8 misnumbered, Epics 9-21 missing

**When Does It Occur?**

This bug occurs whenever:
- A user tries to set up Kanban structure using the framework
- An agent tries to install Kanban epics from canonical templates
- A user expects the full 21-epic structure (core + ancillary)
- Installation process references `CANONICAL_EPICS.md`

**Who is Affected?**

**Primary Affected:**
- Users installing Kanban framework in new projects
- AI agents automating Kanban structure setup
- Projects expecting the full epic structure

**Secondary Affected:**
- Framework maintainers (incomplete documentation)
- Framework users (confusion about epic structure)
- Future framework adopters (incorrect expectations)

---

## Affected Component

**Primary Component:** Kanban Framework - Epic Structure Documentation  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Framework Templates
- [x] Installation Process
- [ ] Backend/API
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [ ] Integration/External Service

**Root Cause:**

The `CANONICAL_EPICS.md` file was never updated to include all 21 epics. The framework documentation only covers Epics 1-7, missing Epic 7 (UXR) and all ancillary epics (9-21). Additionally, Epic 7 (Codebase Maintenance) is misnumbered and should be Epic 8.

**Note:** While `COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md` exists with all Epics 1-23+, `CANONICAL_EPICS.md` remains incomplete and is the primary reference document that users/agents encounter first.

---

## Steps to Reproduce

**UAT Scenario: Setting Up Kanban Structure**

**Context:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as user/client for dev-toolkit project

1. **User Request:** User types: "I want you to setup our Kanban structure, using the [updated] Kanban pack from ai-dev-kit"

2. **Agent Action:** Agent reads Kanban framework documentation:
   - Reads `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/CANONICAL_EPICS.md`
   - Finds only Epics 1-7 documented
   - No mention of Epic 7 (UXR)
   - No mention of Epics 9-21
   - Agent assumes framework only has 7 epics

3. **Agent Creates Structure:** Agent creates new Epic 1 for dev-toolkit:
   - Creates `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-1/Epic-1.md`
   - Creates Story 1 and Story 2 under Epic 1
   - Does NOT use canonical Epic 1 template

4. **User Discovery:** User reviews created structure and identifies gap:
   - User expects Epics 1-21 (core + ancillary)
   - User finds only Epic 1 created
   - User identifies missing Epic 7 (UXR)
   - User identifies Epic 8 misnumbered (should be Epic 8, currently Epic 7)
   - User identifies missing Epics 9-21

5. **User Confirmation:** User confirms expectation:
   - "My understanding is the ai-dev-kit should install the following E/S/T struct:"
   - Lists all 21 expected epics
   - Confirms Epics 1-8 are core, 9-21 are ancillary

**Expected Result:**
- Framework provides all 21 epics
- Core epics (1-8) automatically installed
- Ancillary epics (9-21) available for selection
- Proper epic numbering (Epic 7 = UXR, Epic 8 = Codebase Maintenance)

**Actual Result:**
- Framework only provides 7 epics
- Epic 7 (UXR) missing entirely
- Epic 7 (Codebase Maintenance) should be Epic 8
- Epics 9-21 not documented
- Agent creates incorrect structure

---

## Environment

**Environment:** Development (Framework Installation)  
**Version:** Kanban Framework v2.0.0 (as of 2025-12-10)  
**Repository:** earlution/dev-toolkit (consuming ai-dev-kit framework)  
**Framework Source:** earlution/ai-dev-kit  
**Framework Path:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/`  
**Affected File:** `packages/frameworks/kanban/templates/CANONICAL_EPICS.md`

---

## Impact

**User Impact:**
- [x] Critical - System unusable
- [x] High - Major functionality broken
- [ ] Medium - Some functionality affected
- [ ] Low - Minor issue, workaround available

**Impact Description:**
- **Critical:** Users cannot get expected epic structure during installation
- **High:** Installation creates incorrect epic numbering
- **High:** Missing Epic 7 (UXR) entirely - users cannot use UXR epic
- **Medium:** No way to select ancillary epics (9-21) during setup
- **Medium:** Confusion about epic structure and numbering

**User Experience:**
- Users expect 21-epic structure but only get 7 epics
- Users must manually create missing epics
- Users cannot leverage ancillary epics (9-21) from framework
- Installation process doesn't match user expectations

**Business Impact:**

**Framework Adoption:**
- Users may abandon framework if structure doesn't match expectations
- Framework appears incomplete compared to user expectations
- Framework credibility affected by documentation gaps

**Framework Maintenance:**
- Incomplete documentation creates maintenance burden
- Users create workarounds instead of using framework
- Framework evolution blocked by incomplete structure

**Workaround:**

**Current Workaround:**
- Manually create missing epics (Epic 7: UXR, Epics 9-21)
- Manually renumber Epic 7 (Codebase Maintenance) → Epic 8
- Manually create epic templates from scratch
- Manually update framework documentation
- Reference `COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md` instead

**Workaround Limitations:**
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Doesn't leverage framework templates
- Creates inconsistency across projects
- Doesn't solve root cause
- Users/agents don't know about comprehensive structure document

## Notes

**UAT Context**

This bug report is the result of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) performed by an AI agent (Cursor) acting as a user/client for the dev-toolkit project. The UAT scenario involved:

- **User Role:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as framework consumer
- **User Action:** Requested Kanban structure setup using ai-dev-kit framework
- **Expected Outcome:** Complete 21-epic structure (core + ancillary)
- **Actual Outcome:** Only 7 epics available, missing Epic 7 (UXR) and Epics 9-21
- **User Feedback:** Identified gap and provided expected epic structure

**Rationale**

**Why This Matters:**
- Framework documentation should match user expectations
- Incomplete documentation creates confusion and adoption barriers
- Users expect full epic structure based on framework claims
- Missing epics prevent users from leveraging framework capabilities

**Why This Should Be Fixed:**
- Framework credibility depends on complete documentation
- Users cannot use framework as intended without complete epic structure
- Installation process should match user expectations
- Framework evolution requires complete epic structure

**Expected Epic Structure (Per User Requirements)**

**Core Epics (1-8) - Always Installed:**
1. Epic 1: Project Core
2. Epic 2: Workflow Management
3. Epic 3: Versioning
4. Epic 4: Kanban Framework
5. Epic 5: FR Implementation
6. Epic 6: BR Implementation
7. Epic 7: UXR (MISSING in CANONICAL_EPICS.md)
8. Epic 8: Codebase Maintenance (currently misnumbered as Epic 7 in CANONICAL_EPICS.md)

**Ancillary Epics (9-21) - Users Pick and Choose:**
9. Epic 9: User Management
10. Epic 10: Data Management
11. Epic 11: API & Backend
12. Epic 12: Frontend & UI
13. Epic 13: Testing & QA
14. Epic 14: Deployment & DevOps
15. Epic 15: Security
16. Epic 16: Performance
17. Epic 17: Integration
18. Epic 18: Documentation
19. Epic 19: Analytics
20. Epic 20: Mobile
21. Epic 21: Internationalization

**Note:** The comprehensive structure document (`COMPREHENSIVE_CANONICAL_EST_STRUCTURE.md`) exists with Epics 1-23+ including Epic 22 (Architecture Refactoring) and Epic 23 (CI/CD), but `CANONICAL_EPICS.md` remains the primary reference that users/agents encounter first.
