# Feature Request: Localization and Language Selection (UK/US English + International)

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-09  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** PENDING

---

## Summary

Add language/locale selection at the very beginning of the ai-dev-kit setup process, starting with UK English and US English variants, with extensibility for other major languages. This addresses cultural preferences and improves accessibility for international users.

---

## Description

### Problem Statement

Currently, ai-dev-kit uses US English throughout all documentation, templates, and user-facing content. While US English is more prevalent globally (~250-260M speakers in US vs ~70M in UK), users from different regions have cultural preferences for their English variant. Additionally, non-English speakers would benefit from localized versions.

**User Perspective:**
- UK English speakers prefer UK spelling and terminology (e.g., "colour" vs "color", "organise" vs "organize")
- US English speakers are accustomed to US conventions
- International users may prefer other languages entirely
- Cultural preference is not about "better" but about familiarity and comfort

### Use Case

**Primary Use Case: UK/US English Selection**
1. User starts ai-dev-kit setup (via template, CLI, or installer)
2. **First prompt:** "Select your preferred English variant: [UK English] [US English]"
3. All subsequent documentation, templates, and generated content use selected variant
4. User feels comfortable and familiar with the language conventions

**Extended Use Case: International Localization**
1. User starts ai-dev-kit setup
2. **First prompt:** "Select your language: [English (UK)] [English (US)] [Español] [Français] [Deutsch] [中文] [日本語] [Português] [Other...]"
3. All content is localized to selected language
4. Significantly improves accessibility for non-English speakers

### Who Would Benefit

- **UK English speakers:** Cultural preference and familiarity
- **US English speakers:** Already served, but explicit selection improves clarity
- **International developers:** Non-English speakers gain access to framework
- **Multi-language teams:** Teams can choose their preferred language
- **Framework adoption:** Lower barrier to entry for international users

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: UK/US English Selection (MVP)

**1. Language Selection at Setup Start**

Add language selection as the first step in all setup processes:

**Template Setup:**
- GitHub template includes language selection prompt
- Selection stored in `ai-dev-kit-config.yaml`

**CLI Tool:**
```bash
ai-dev-kit init
# First prompt:
# Select your preferred English variant:
# [1] UK English (colour, organise, realise)
# [2] US English (color, organize, realize)
# Enter choice [1-2]: _
```

**RW Installer:**
```bash
python scripts/install_release_workflow.py
# First prompt:
# Select your preferred English variant:
# [1] UK English
# [2] US English
# Enter choice [1-2]: _
```

**2. Content Structure**

Create language-specific content directories:
```
packages/frameworks/kanban/
  locales/
    en-GB/          # UK English
      templates/
      docs/
    en-US/          # US English (default)
      templates/
      docs/
```

**3. Configuration**

Add to `ai-dev-kit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
localization:
  language: "en-GB"  # or "en-US"
  variant: "UK"      # or "US"
```

**4. Content Generation**

All content generation (RW, templates, etc.) reads language preference and uses appropriate variant.

### Phase 2: International Localization

**1. Translation Infrastructure**

Use standard i18n approach:
- Translation keys (e.g., `setup.welcome.title`)
- Translation files per language (`locales/en-GB/`, `locales/es/`, etc.)
- Translation management system
- Fallback chain (selected language → English → US English)

**2. Translation Workflow**

- Identify all translatable strings
- Create translation files
- Translation review process
- Integration with existing workflows

**3. Cultural Adaptation**

- Locale-specific formatting (date/time/numbers)
- Cultural context in examples
- Right-to-left (RTL) support for Arabic/Hebrew

## Notes

**Language Statistics (for reference):**
- **US English:** ~250-260M native speakers (US population)
- **UK English:** ~70M native speakers (UK population)
- **International English:** Varies by region
  - Europe: Often UK English (taught in schools)
  - Asia: Often US English (tech industry influence)
  - Other regions: Mixed

**User's Perception Check:**
- User's perception that US English is more common internationally (especially in tech) is generally accurate
- However, UK English is still preferred in many Commonwealth countries and Europe
- Both variants are valid and should be supported

**Implementation Priority:**
- Phase 1 (UK/US English) is recommended as MVP
- Phase 2 (International) can follow based on demand and resources
- Both phases map to Epic 21 in the comprehensive canonical structure
