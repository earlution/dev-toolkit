# Feature Request: Migration Utilities and Installation Modes for Pre-Existing Kanban Structures

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-01-27  
**Submitted By:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as user/client for dev-toolkit  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**GitHub Issue:** [#3](https://github.com/earlution/ai-dev-kit/issues/3)

---

## Summary

Add migration utilities and installation modes to the Kanban framework to support projects with pre-existing Kanban (or Sprint/Agile) structures, enabling safe adoption without data loss.

---

## Description

### What Functionality is Desired?

**Migration Utilities:**
1. **Detection Utility:** Scan and detect existing Kanban structures
2. **Analysis Utility:** Analyze existing structure and map to E/S/T format
3. **Migration Utility:** Migrate existing work items to canonical structure
4. **Preservation Utility:** Backup and preserve existing work during migration

**Installation Modes:**
1. **Fresh Install:** Current behavior (assumes clean slate)
2. **Migration Install:** Detect existing structure and migrate it
3. **Update Install:** Update existing framework installation
4. **Hybrid Install:** Preserve project epics, install framework epics

### What Problem Does This Solve?

**Current Problems:**
- Projects with existing Kanban cannot safely adopt framework
- Risk of overwriting existing work during installation
- No migration path from existing systems (Kanban, Sprints, Issues)
- Manual migration required (error-prone, time-consuming)
- Framework adoption barriers for real-world projects

**Solution:**
- Detection utilities identify existing structures
- Analysis utilities map existing work to E/S/T format
- Migration utilities convert existing items safely
- Installation modes support different scenarios
- Framework becomes adoptable by projects with existing Kanban

### What is the Use Case?

**Primary Use Case:**
A project (dev-toolkit) has an existing Kanban structure with completed work. The project wants to adopt the ai-dev-kit Kanban framework but needs to preserve existing work and migrate it to the canonical E/S/T structure.

**Additional Use Cases:**
1. **Sprint Migration:** Project with Sprint-based system wants to migrate to E/S/T Kanban
2. **Issue Tracker Migration:** Project using GitHub Issues/Jira wants to migrate to E/S/T Kanban
3. **Framework Update:** Project updating from older framework version needs structure migration
4. **Mixed Structure:** Project with mix of Kanban/Sprints/Issues wants unified E/S/T structure

### Who Would Benefit from This Feature?

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
- Projects with existing Kanban systems
- Projects migrating from Sprint-based systems
- Projects with issue tracker integration
- Projects updating framework versions
- AI agents automating Kanban setup

**Secondary Beneficiaries:**
- Framework adoption (removes barriers)
- Framework credibility (handles real-world scenarios)
- User experience (smooth migration process)

## Scope Analysis

**Problem Domain:** Kanban Framework Installation and Migration  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Installation Process
- [x] Migration Utilities
- [x] Detection Mechanisms
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Backend/API
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [ ] Testing

**Estimated Complexity:**
- [ ] Simple (1-3 days)

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Pre-Existing Kanban Migration

**Actor:** Project with existing Kanban structure  
**Goal:** Adopt ai-dev-kit Kanban framework while preserving existing work  
**Steps:**
1. Run detection utility to identify existing structure
2. Run analysis utility to map existing work to E/S/T
3. Review migration plan
4. Run migration utility to convert existing items
5. Verify migration success
6. Continue using framework

**Success Criteria:**
- All existing work preserved
- All work items migrated to canonical format
- No data loss
- Framework ready for use

### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 2: Sprint-Based Migration**
- Project with Sprint system wants to migrate to E/S/T Kanban
- Detection utility identifies Sprint structure
- Analysis utility maps Sprints to Epics, Sprint items to Stories
- Migration utility converts to E/S/T format

**Use Case 3: Issue Tracker Migration**
- Project using GitHub Issues wants to migrate to E/S/T Kanban
- Detection utility identifies Issues structure
- Analysis utility maps Issues to Tasks, Issue labels to Epics/Stories
- Migration utility converts to E/S/T format

**Use Case 4: Framework Update**
- Project updating from older framework version
- Detection utility identifies existing framework structure
- Analysis utility maps to new structure
- Migration utility updates to new format

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-1:** Detection utility (`detect_existing_structure.py`) can scan and detect existing Kanban structures
