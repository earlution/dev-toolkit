# Epic 10, Story 2: Architecture & SOLID Design

**Status:** TODO  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Estimated Effort:** [TBD]  
**Actual Effort:** [TBD]  
**Version:** v0.10.2.1+1  
**Code:** E10S02

---

## Task Checklist

- [ ] **E10:S02:T01 – Architecture overview (ingestion, curation, storage, APIs, UI)**  
- [ ] **E10:S02:T02 – Component design aligned to SOLID principles**  
- [ ] **E10:S02:T03 – Data model refinement (problem, solutions, examples, provenance)**  
- [ ] **E10:S02:T04 – Interfaces/contracts for services (ingestion, curation, retrieval)**  
- [ ] **E10:S02:T05 – Non-functional design (latency, auditability, privacy, licensing)**

---

## Goal

Produce the architecture and component design for the Problem-Solution KB platform, aligned to SOLID principles, covering ingestion, curation, storage (doc + vector + relational edges), APIs (REST/GraphQL + embeddings), and UI integration.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Architecture overview documented with key components and interactions
- [ ] SOLID-aligned component responsibilities defined
- [ ] Data model refined and validated against FR-009 requirements
- [ ] Service interfaces/contracts drafted (ingestion, curation, retrieval)
- [ ] NFRs addressed (latency, auditability, privacy, licensing)
- [ ] Ready handoff to API/UI/embeddings design story
