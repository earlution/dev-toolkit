   - Validated "ALL sections" requirement implementation
   - Validated forensic marker format consistency
   - Validated consistency across all Kanban documents

2. **Gap Identification:**
   - Documented gaps with evidence and recommendations
   - Created comprehensive validation report (`T004-rw-kanban-validation.md`)
   - Identified 3 critical gaps and 3 minor gaps

3. **Task Creation:**

## Gaps Addressed

### Gap 1: Epic Story Checklist Not Updated ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Story Checklist in Epic document not consistently updated with Task-level version markers
- Only showed Story-level status, not individual Task completions
- Created inconsistency with detailed sections

**Evidence from T004:**
- Epic-4.md Story Checklist: `- [ ] **E4:S03 – Kanban + Versioning + RW Integration** - IN PROGRESS`
- Missing: Task-level version markers
- Reference: T004 validation report, Section 2.1

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated Epic-4.md Story Checklist to include Task-level version markers
- Format: `- [ ] **E4:S03 – Story Name** - IN PROGRESS (v{version})`
- Added Task completion list: `Tasks: T001 ✅ (v0.4.3.1+1), T002 ✅ (v0.4.3.2+2), T003 ✅ (v0.4.3.3+1), T004 ✅ (v0.4.3.4+1)`

**Files Updated:**
- `KB/PM_and_Portfolio/kanban/epics/Epic-4/Epic-4.md` (Story Checklist section)

### Gap 2: Forensic Marker Format Inconsistency ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Some sections used correct format: `✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.3.3+1)` ✅
- Other sections missing version markers: `✅ **COMPLETE**` ⚠️
- Detailed Task sections didn't always include version markers

**Evidence from T004:**
- Story document Task Checklist: `✅ COMPLETE (v0.4.3.3+1)` ✅ (correct)
- Story document detailed sections: `✅ **COMPLETE**` ⚠️ (missing version)
- Reference: T004 validation report, Section 2.4

**Fix Applied:**
- Standardized forensic marker format across all sections
- Format: `✅ COMPLETE (v{version})` (canonical format)
- Updated all Task status fields in Story document
- Format: `**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (v{version}) - [description]`

### Gap 3: "ALL Sections" Requirement Not Fully Implemented ✅ FIXED
