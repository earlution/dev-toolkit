# Feature Request: Package Uninstall Capabilities

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-01-27  
**Submitted By:** AI Agent (Cursor) acting as user/client for dev-toolkit  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - v0.2.6.3+1 (2025-12-10)

---

## Summary

Add uninstall capabilities for ai-dev-kit packages/frameworks to support users who need to (a) uninstall any given package, (b) recover from installation/configuration errors, and (c) handle breaking changes from package updates.

---

## Description

### What Functionality is Desired?

**Uninstall Capabilities:**
1. **Package Uninstall:** Remove a specific framework/package from a project
2. **Cleanup Utilities:** Remove all traces of a package (files, config, dependencies)
3. **Rollback Support:** Revert to previous package version or remove package entirely
4. **Recovery Mode:** Clean up failed installations or misconfigurations
5. **Breaking Change Recovery:** Handle breaking changes by uninstalling problematic updates

**Uninstall Methods:**
- CLI command: `ai-dev-kit uninstall <package>`
- Manual cleanup guide for each backend
- Automated cleanup scripts
- Recovery utilities for failed installations

### What Problem Does This Solve?

**Current Problems:**
- No way to uninstall packages once installed
- Users stuck with packages they no longer need
- Cannot recover from installation errors
- Cannot rollback from breaking changes
- Manual cleanup required (error-prone, incomplete)
- Framework files remain after "removal"

**Solution:**
- Uninstall command removes packages cleanly
- Cleanup utilities remove all traces
- Recovery mode fixes failed installations
- Rollback support handles breaking changes
- Framework becomes manageable and reversible

### What is the Use Case?

**Use Case A: Uninstall Unused Package**
A project installed a framework but no longer needs it. User wants to remove it cleanly without leaving orphaned files or configuration.

**Use Case B: Recover from Installation Errors**
A package installation failed or was misconfigured, leaving the project in a broken state. User needs to clean up and start fresh.

**Use Case C: Handle Breaking Changes**
A package update introduced breaking changes that break the project. User needs to uninstall the problematic version and either rollback or remove entirely.

**Use Case D: Clean Up Failed Migrations**
A migration from one package version to another failed. User needs to clean up the partial migration and restore to a working state.

**Use Case E: Remove Package to Switch Backends**
A project wants to switch from Git submodule to npm package manager. User needs to uninstall Git submodule version before installing npm version.

### Who Would Benefit from This Feature?

**Primary Beneficiaries:**
- Users who installed packages they no longer need
- Users recovering from installation errors
- Users handling breaking changes from updates
- Users switching between installation methods
- Users cleaning up failed migrations

**Secondary Beneficiaries:**
- Framework adoption (removes fear of commitment)
- Framework credibility (shows framework is manageable)
- User confidence (can experiment without risk)

## Scope Analysis

**Problem Domain:** Package Management - Uninstall and Cleanup  
**Affected Areas:**
- [x] Installation Process
- [x] Package Management
- [x] Configuration Management
- [x] Dependency Management
- [x] Documentation
- [ ] Backend/API

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Uninstall Unused Package

**Actor:** Project maintainer  
**Goal:** Remove a framework package that is no longer needed  
**Steps:**
1. Run `ai-dev-kit uninstall workflow-mgmt`
2. System detects package and dependencies
3. System shows what will be removed
4. User confirms uninstall
5. System creates backup
6. System removes package files
7. System removes configuration entries
8. System removes dependencies
9. System verifies cleanup
10. Project ready for new package or continues without package

**Success Criteria:**
- Package completely removed
- No orphaned files
- Configuration cleaned up
- Project still functional
- Backup available for recovery

### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 2: Recover from Installation Errors**
- Installation failed partway through
- Project in broken state
- Run `ai-dev-kit uninstall --recover workflow-mgmt`
- System detects failed installation
- System cleans up partial installation
- Project restored to working state

**Use Case 3: Handle Breaking Changes**
- Package update broke project
- Run `ai-dev-kit uninstall workflow-mgmt@2.1.0`
- System removes problematic version
- Option to rollback to previous version
- Or remove package entirely

**Use Case 4: Switch Installation Methods**
- Currently using Git submodule
- Want to switch to npm
- Run `ai-dev-kit uninstall workflow-mgmt --backend git-submodule`
- System removes Git submodule
- Then install via npm: `ai-dev-kit install workflow-mgmt --backend npm`

## Notes

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Basic Uninstall (Critical)**
- Create `uninstall` command
- Remove package files
- Remove configuration entries
- Create backup before removal

**Phase 2: Cleanup Verification (High Priority)**
- Verify all files removed
- Verify configuration cleaned
- Verify dependencies removed
- Report any remaining traces

**Phase 3: Recovery Mode (High Priority)**
- Detect failed installation state
- Clean up partial installations
- Restore project to working state

**Phase 4: Rollback Support (Medium Priority)**
- Uninstall current version
- Restore previous version option
- Or remove package entirely

**Phase 5: Backend-Specific Support (Medium Priority)**
- Git submodule uninstall
- npm package uninstall
- pip package uninstall
- CLI tool uninstall

### Uninstall Scenarios

1. **Clean Uninstall:** Package no longer needed, remove cleanly
2. **Recovery Uninstall:** Fix failed installation, clean up errors
3. **Rollback Uninstall:** Handle breaking changes, restore previous version
4. **Backend Switch:** Remove from one backend, install via another
5. **Partial Cleanup:** Remove specific components, keep others

### Safety Considerations

**Backup Before Removal:**
- Always create backup before uninstall
- Backup includes package files and configuration
- Backup enables recovery if needed

**Dependency Validation:**
- Check for dependencies before removal
- Warn if dependencies exist
- Provide override option for forced removal

**Confirmation Required:**
- Interactive confirmation before removal
- Show what will be removed
- Require explicit confirmation
