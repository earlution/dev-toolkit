# Feature Request: GitHub Submission for FR, BR, and UXR

**Type:** Feature Request (FR)  
**Submitted:** 2025-12-09  
**Submitted By:** User  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ACCEPTED - IMPLEMENTED

---

## Summary

Enable evaluation methods to submit Bug Reports (BR), Feature Requests (FR), or User Experience Research reports (UXR) via GitHub (e.g., GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, or custom GitHub integration).

---

## Description

**What functionality is desired?**
Create a mechanism for external contributors, users, or evaluation methods to submit Bug Reports (BR), Feature Requests (FR), or User Experience Research reports (UXR) directly through GitHub, rather than requiring manual creation of FR/BR documents in the repository.

**What problem does this solve?**
- **Accessibility:** Makes it easier for external contributors to submit feedback without needing repository access or knowledge of the Kanban framework structure
- **Automation:** Enables automated evaluation methods (e.g., AI agents, testing frameworks) to submit reports programmatically
- **Integration:** Leverages GitHub's native issue tracking and discussion features
- **Workflow:** Streamlines the intake process by accepting submissions through familiar GitHub interfaces

**What is the use case?**
1. **External Contributors:** Users who want to report bugs or request features but don't have repository write access
2. **Automated Evaluation:** Testing frameworks or AI agents that need to programmatically submit bug reports or feature requests
3. **User Experience Research:** UX researchers who want to submit research findings or usability reports
4. **Community Feedback:** Community members who prefer GitHub Issues/Discussions over direct repository contributions

**Who would benefit from this feature?**
- External contributors and users
- Automated testing and evaluation systems
- UX researchers and designers
- Community members
- Project maintainers (streamlined intake process)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Support GitHub Issues as submission channel for BR, FR, and UXR
- [ ] Support GitHub Discussions as alternative submission channel (optional)
- [ ] Automatic conversion from GitHub Issue/Discussion to FR/BR/UXR document
- [ ] Template-based issue forms for structured submissions (GitHub Issue Forms)
- [ ] Labeling system to categorize submissions (bug, feature, ux-research)
- [ ] Integration with existing FR/BR intake workflow (FR/BR → Task → Story → Epic)
- [ ] Automatic creation of FR/BR/UXR documents from GitHub submissions
- [ ] Bidirectional linking between GitHub Issues and FR/BR documents

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance:** Conversion process should complete within reasonable time (< 30 seconds)
- [ ] **Security:** Validate and sanitize user input from GitHub submissions
- [ ] **Usability:** Clear templates and instructions for GitHub submission
- [ ] **Compatibility:** Work with GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, and GitHub Issue Forms
- [ ] **Reliability:** Handle edge cases (malformed submissions, missing fields, etc.)

## Scope Analysis

**Problem Domain:** FR/BR Intake, GitHub Integration, Automation  
**Affected Areas:**
- [ ] Backend/API
- [ ] Frontend/UI
- [ ] Database/Schema
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Testing
- [x] Other: GitHub Actions, Issue Templates, Automation Scripts

**Estimated Complexity:**
- [ ] Simple (1-3 days)
- [x] Medium (1 week)
- [ ] Complex (2+ weeks)
- [ ] Very Complex (1+ month)

## Use Cases

**Primary Use Case:**
An external contributor discovers a bug and wants to report it. They create a GitHub Issue using the bug report template. The system automatically converts the GitHub Issue into a BR document, creates the associated Kanban task, and links the Issue to the BR document.

**Additional Use Cases:**
1. **Automated Testing:** A CI/CD pipeline runs automated tests and creates GitHub Issues for failed tests. These are automatically converted to BR documents.
2. **UX Research Submission:** A UX researcher completes a usability study and submits findings via GitHub Discussion. The system converts it to a UXR document.
3. **Feature Request from Community:** A community member suggests a feature via GitHub Issue. The system converts it to an FR document and routes it through the intake workflow.
4. **Bulk Import:** Historical GitHub Issues are batch-converted to FR/BR documents for migration purposes.
