## About The Project

**Vibe Dev Kit** is a collection of **portable, battle-tested frameworks** that help you build and run real software projects using AI-first development workflows. Instead of starting from scratch or cobbling together incomplete solutions, you get complete, documented frameworks that you can copy into your project and adapt to your needs.

### What Problem Does This Solve?

If you're building software with AI coding assistants (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or similar), you've probably encountered these challenges:

- **No Standard Workflows**: Every project reinvents release processes, versioning strategies, and project management
- **Incomplete Solutions**: You find a workflow here, a template there, but nothing that works together cohesively
- **Documentation Gaps**: Tools exist but lack clear guides for non-experts or integration instructions
- **Versioning Chaos**: Semantic versioning doesn't fit AI-driven development patterns where features emerge iteratively
- **Knowledge Loss**: Best practices exist in your head or scattered docs, not in reusable frameworks

**Vibe Dev Kit solves these problems** by providing:

✅ **Complete Frameworks** – Not just ideas, but full implementations with documentation  
✅ **Portable & Modular** – Copy what you need, adapt it to your project structure  
✅ **AI-First Design** – Built specifically for AI-assisted development workflows  
✅ **Battle-Tested** – Used in real projects (200K+ LOC commercial products)  
✅ **Well-Documented** – Clear guides for both technical and non-technical users  
✅ **Integrated Systems** – Frameworks work together seamlessly (Kanban → Versioning → Release Workflow)

### Who Is This For?

- **Solo Developers** building products with AI assistance
- **Small Teams** needing structure without bureaucracy
- **Non-Technical Founders** who want to understand and guide development
- **Junior Engineers** learning best practices through proven frameworks
- **Anyone** building software with AI coding assistants who wants to do it right

---

## Built With

The dev kit itself is **deliberately tool-agnostic** in runtime dependencies, but assumes:

- **Git & GitHub** – For source control and collaboration
- **AI Coding Assistants** – Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or similar (for workflow execution)
- **Markdown** – For documentation, policies, and knowledge base

**Design Philosophy:**

- **Portable** – Copy packages into any project, adapt locally (current)
- **Dependency-Based** – Install as dependencies with auto-updates (coming in Epic 6)
- **Modular** – Use one framework or combine multiple
- **Documentation-First** – Every package includes implementation guides
- **Versioned** – Using `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD` for forensic traceability

**Vision:** Frameworks are transitioning from copy-paste packages to **reusable, auto-updating dependencies**. When frameworks are improved, projects using them can automatically receive updates through Git submodules, CLI tools, or package managers. See [Framework Dependency Architecture](KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/framework-dependency-architecture.md) for details.

**Inspiration & Standards:**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using Vibe Dev Kit, you'll need:

- **Git** installed on your system
- **A GitHub account** (recommended for collaboration)
- **A modern code editor** with AI assistant support:
  - [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) (recommended)
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Or similar AI coding assistant
- **Basic familiarity** with:
  - Command line (terminal)
  - Git basics (clone, commit, push)
  - Markdown (for reading documentation)

**Don't worry if you're not an expert** – each framework includes step-by-step guides.

### Installation

**Current Approach (Copy-Paste):** Vibe Dev Kit frameworks can be **copied** into your project. This keeps your project independent and allows you to customize everything.

**Future Approach (Dependencies - Epic 6):** Frameworks will be installable as **dependencies** with automatic updates. See [Framework Dependency Architecture](KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/framework-dependency-architecture.md) for the roadmap.

#### Step 1: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/earlution/vibe-dev-kit.git
cd vibe-dev-kit
```

#### Step 2: Browse Available Frameworks

```bash
# See what's available
ls packages/frameworks/

# Explore a specific framework
cd packages/frameworks/workflow\ mgt/
cat README.md
```

#### Step 3: Copy a Framework to Your Project

```bash
# Example: Copy the Release Workflow framework
cp -r packages/frameworks/workflow\ mgt/ /path/to/your/project/

# Or copy multiple frameworks
cp -r packages/frameworks/workflow\ mgt/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r "packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning" /path/to/your/project/numbering-and-versioning
cp -r packages/frameworks/kanban/ /path/to/your/project/
```

#### Step 4: Follow the Framework's Implementation Guide

Each framework includes:
- **README.md** – Overview and quick start
- **PACKAGE_OVERVIEW.md** – Structure and concepts
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** – Step-by-step setup instructions
- **Templates** – Ready-to-use templates and examples

Navigate to your copied framework and follow its documentation:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project/workflow\ mgt/
cat README.md
cat IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

---

## Usage

### Quick Start: Release Workflow

The **Release Workflow (RW)** framework is the most popular starting point. It provides an AI-driven release process that handles versioning, changelogs, git operations, and validation automatically.

#### Option 1: Use the Installer (Recommended)

The RW framework includes an installer that sets everything up automatically:

```bash
# 1. Copy the workflow package to your project
cp -r /path/to/vibe-dev-kit/packages/frameworks/workflow\ mgt/* /path/to/your/project/

# 2. Run the installer
cd /path/to/your/project
python scripts/install_release_workflow.py

# 3. Answer a few questions (or use --mode c for full stack)
# 4. Start using RW by typing "RW" in your AI assistant!
```

**That's it!** The installer generates `rw-config.yaml`, updates `.cursorrules`, and patches workflow files automatically.

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup, see the [RW Quickstart Guide](packages/frameworks/workflow%20mgt/KB/Documentation/Developer_Docs/vwmp/rw-installer-quickstart-guide.md).

### Using Multiple Frameworks Together

Frameworks are designed to work together. The recommended combination:

1. **Kanban** – Organize work into Epics, Stories, and Tasks
2. **Numbering & Versioning** – Version your work using `RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD`
3. **Release Workflow** – Automate releases with AI-driven workflows

**Installation:**

```bash
# Copy all three frameworks
cp -r packages/frameworks/kanban/ /path/to/your/project/
cp -r "packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning" /path/to/your/project/numbering-and-versioning
cp -r packages/frameworks/workflow\ mgt/ /path/to/your/project/

# Follow each framework's integration guide
```

Each framework's README includes integration instructions for working with other frameworks.

### Package Structure

Every framework follows a consistent structure:

```
framework-name/
├── README.md                    # Overview and quick start
├── PACKAGE_OVERVIEW.md          # Structure and key concepts
├── IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md      # Step-by-step setup
├── templates/                   # Ready-to-use templates
├── integration/                 # Guides for integrating with other frameworks
└── KB/                          # Knowledge base (policies, examples)
```
