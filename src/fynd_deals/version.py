Vibe Dev Kit Version File

This file defines the version for the vibe-dev-kit repository using the RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD schema.

Schema: RC.EPIC.STORY.TASK+BUILD
- RC: Release Candidate (0 = development, 1+ = release candidate)
- EPIC: Dev-kit Epic number (1-4+)
- STORY: Story number within epic
- TASK: Task number within story
- BUILD: Build number (increments per release within task)

Version ordering is canonical (by version number, not timestamp).
This enables parallel epic development and accurate changelog ordering.

See: KB/Architecture/Standards_and_ADRs/dev-kit-versioning-policy.md
Framework: packages/frameworks/numbering & versioning/versioning-policy.md
